EU rejects German call to boycott British lamb 
Peter Blackburn 
BRUSSELS dashnum 
The European Commission said on Thursday it disagreed with German advice to consumers to shun British lamb until scientists determine whether mad cow disease can be transmitted to sheep 
Germany s representative to the European Union s veterinary committee Werner Zwingmann said on Wednesday consumers should buy sheepmeat from countries other than Britain until the scientific advice was clearer 
We do nt support any such recommendation because we do nt see any grounds for it the Commission s chief spokesman Nikolaus van der Pas told a news briefing 
He said further scientific study was required and if it was found that action was needed it should be taken by the European Union 
He said a proposal last month by EU Farm Commissioner Franz Fischler to ban sheep brains spleens and spinal cords from the human and animal food chains was a highly specific and precautionary move to protect human health 
Fischler proposed EUwide measures after reports from Britain and France that under laboratory conditions sheep could contract Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy BSE mad cow disease 
But Fischler agreed to review his proposal after the EU s standing veterinary committee mational animal health officials questioned if such action was justified as there was only a slight risk to human health 
Spanish Farm Minister Loyola de Palacio had earlier accused Fischler at an EU farm ministers meeting of causing unjustified alarm through dangerous generalisation 

Only France and Britain backed Fischler s proposal 
The EU s scientific veterinary and multidisciplinary committees are due to reexamine the issue early next month and make recommendations to the senior veterinary officials 
Sheep have long been known to contract scrapie a brainwasting disease similar to BSE which is believed to have been transferred to cattle through feed containing animal waste 
British farmers denied on Thursday there was any danger to human health from their sheep but expressed concern that German government advice to consumers to avoid British lamb might influence consumers across Europe 
What we have to be extremely careful of is how other countries are going to take Germany s lead Welsh National Farmers Union NFU chairman John Lloyd Jones said on BBC radio 
Bonn has led efforts to protect public health after consumer confidence collapsed in March after a British report suggested humans could contract an illness similar to mad cow disease by eating contaminated beef 
Germany imported num sheep from Britain last year nearly half of total imports 
It brought in num tonnes of British mutton some num percent of overall imports

Israel plays down fears of war with Syria 
Colleen Siegel 
JERUSALEM dashnum 
Israel s outgoing peace negotiator with Syria said on Thursday current tensions between the two countries appeared to be a storm in a teacup 
Itamar Rabinovich who as Israel s ambassador to Washington conducted unfruitful negotiations with Syria told Israel Radio it looked like Damascus wanted to talk rather than fight 
It appears to me the Syrian priority is still to negotiate 
The Syrians are confused they are definitely tense but the general assessment here in Washington is that this is essentially a storm in a teacup he said 
Rabinovich is winding up his term as ambassador 
He will be replaced by Eliahu BenElissar a former Israeli envoy to Egypt and rightwing Likud party politician 
Israel on Wednesday sent Syria a message via Washington saying it was committed to peace and wanted to open negotiations without preconditions 
But it slammed Damascus for creating what it called a dangerous atmosphere 
Syria accused Israel on Wednesday of launching a hysterical campaign against it after Israeli television reported that Damascus had recently test fired a missile 
It said its arms purchases were for defensive purposes 
The message that we sent to Syrian President Hafez al Assad is that Israel is ready at any time without preconditions to enter peace negotiations Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy told Israel Radio in an interview 
Tension has mounted since Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu took office in June vowing to retain the Golan Heights Israel captured from Syria in the year Middle East war 
IsraeliSyrian peace talks have been deadlocked over the Golan since year despite the previous government s willingness to make Golan concessions 
Peace talks between the two sides were last held in February 
The voices coming out of Damascus are bad not good 
The media 
are full of expressions and declarations that must be worrying 
this artificial atmosphere is very dangerous because those who spread it could become its prisoners Levy said 
We expect from Syria if its face is to peace that it will answer Israel s message to enter peace negotiations because that is our goal he said 
We do not want a war God forbid 
No one benefits from wars 
Israel s Channel Two television said Damascus had sent a calming signal to Israel 
It gave no source for the report 
Netanyahu and Levy s spokesmen said they could not confirm it 
The television also said that Netanyahu had sent messages to reassure Syria via Cairo the United States and Moscow

Arafat subsequently cancelled a meeting between Israeli and PLO officials on civilian affairs at the Allenby Bridge crossing between Jordan and the West Bank

Three Afghan guards brought to the United Arab Emirates last week by Russian hostages who escaped from the Taleban militia will return to Afghanistan in a few days the Afghan embassy in Abu Dhabi said on Thursday 
Our ambassador is in touch with the UAE foreign ministry 
Their return to Afghanistan will take place in two or three days an embassy official said 
The embassy is issuing them travel documents for their return to their homeland 
There is no objection to their travel he added 
The three Islamic Taleban guards were overpowered by seven Russian aircrew who escaped to UAE state Sharjah last Friday on board their own aircraft after a year in the captivity of Taleban militia in Kandahar in southern Afghanistan 
The UAE said on Monday it would hand over the three to the International Red Crescent possibly last Tuesday 
It has since been silent on the issue 
When asked whether the three guards would travel back to Kandahar or the Afghan capital Kabul the embassy official said That has not been decided but possibly Kandahar 
Kandahar is the headquarters of the opposition Taleban militia 
Kabul is controlled by President Burhanuddin Rabbani s government which Taleban is fighting to overthrow 
The embassy official said the three men believed to be in their 20s were currently in Abu Dhabi 
He did not elaborate 
The Russians working for the Aerostan firm in the Russian republic of Tatarstan were taken hostage after a Taleban MiG19 fighter forced their cargo plane to land in August year 
Taleban said its shipment of ammunition from Albania was evidence of Russian military support for Rabbani s government 
Moscow said the crew s nationality was coincidental 
Numerous diplomatic attempts to free the seven failed

Garlic pills do nt lower cholesterol study finds 
LONDON dashnum 
Garlic pills may not lower blood cholesterol and studies that show they do may be flawed British researchers have reported 
A study by a team of doctors at Oxford University has found people with high blood cholesterol do not benefit significantly from taking garlic tablets 
The study involved num people with high blood cholesterol levels 
They were given num milligrams a day of dried garlic powder or placebo tablets 
There were no significant differences between the groups receiving garlic and placebo they wrote in the Journal of the Royal College of Physicians 
Those taking part were told to eat a lowfat diet for six weeks before they started taking the pills and their blood cholesterol measured before and after the sixweek period 
The researchers said this would make their findings more accurate 
Several studies have found garlic pills can lower blood pressure and blood cholesterol 
But the Oxford team disputed these findings and said either previous trials may have been interpreted incorrectly those taking part were not given special diets beforehand or the duration of the studies may have been too short 
The sixmonth trial was funded by the British Heart Foundation and Lichtwer Pharma GmbH which makes Kwai brand garlic tablets 
The study did not address whether whole garlic could affect cholesterol

Tennis Philippoussis looms for Sampras in US Open 
Bill Berkrot 
NEW YORK dashnum 
World number one Pete Sampras seeking his first Grand Slam title of the year and women s top seed Steffi Graf aiming for her third should be able to ease into the year s final major which begins on Monday 
Sampras opens the defence of his US Open crown against David Rikl of the Czech Republic while topranked Graf begins her title defence against Yayuk Basuki of Indonesia 
Wednesday s US Open draw ceremony revealed that both title holders should run into their first serious opposition in the third round 
Looming in Sampras s future is a likely thirdround date with recent nemesis Mark Philippoussis the rising Australian who took out Sampras in the third round of the Australian Open in January 
Sampras avenged that defeat with a straight sets win over the 19yearold power hitter in the second round at Wimbledon and their rubber match in New York could provide some firstweek fireworks 
While only a stunning upset will keep Graf from sailing through to a predictable semifinal showdown with third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the German star could also be tested in the third round where she will probably face 28thranked veteran Natasha Zvereva of Belarus 
There will be no repeat of last year s men s final with eighthranked Andre Agassi landing in Sampras s half of the draw 
Bumping Agassi up to the sixth seeding avoided the possibility that he would run into Sampras as early as the quarterfinals but they could lock horns in the semis 
Olympic champion Agassi meets Karim Alami of Morocco in the first round 
Surprise second seed Michael Chang ranked third in the world opens against Czech Daniel Vacek while women s second seed Monica Seles drew American Anne Miller as her first victim 
Secondranked Austrian Thomas Muster who was seeded third did not have the luck of the draw with him 
In the first round Muster faces American Richey Reneberg who has been playing some of the best tennis of his career of late 
If he survives Muster is seeded to run into either fifthseeded Wimbledon champion Richard Krajicek of the Netherlands or 12thseeded American Todd Martin in the quarterfinals in Chang s half of the draw 
Perhaps the best yet most unfortunate firstround matchup of the men s competition pits eighth seed Jim Courier against retiring star Stefan Edberg 
The popular Swede is playing his final major tournament next week and the twotime champion s Grand Slam farewell could well be a onematch affair 
With the exception of a Philippoussis showdown Sampras looks to have landed in a comfortable quarter of the draw with the likes of Frenchman Cedric Pioline and ailing French Open champion Yevgeny Kafelnikov who is nursing a rib injury in his path 
Seles runnerup to Graf last year is seeded to run into fifthranked German Anke Huber in the quarterfinals with fourth seed Conchita Martinez or eighthseeded Olympic champion Lindsay Davenport looking like her most likely semifinal opponents 
But Huber will be tested immediately with a firstround encounter against dangerous 18thranked South African Amanda Coetzer 
Sanchez Vicario runnerup to Graf at the French Open and Wimbledon begins play against a qualifier in a quarter of the draw that includes young talent Martina Hingis the 16th seed before a probable quarterfinal clash with seventhseeded veteran Jana Novotna 
Martinez begins play against Ruxandra Dragomir of Romania

Topseeded Thomas Muster of Austria was beaten dashnum dashnum by 123rdranked Daniel Nestor of Canada on Wednesday in his first match of the num million Canadian Open 
A lefthander with a strong serve Nestor kept the rallies short by constantly attacking the net and the tactic worked in the secondround match against Muster playing his first match after receiving a firstround bye along with the other top eight seeds 
The tournament also lost its second seed on the third day of play when secondseeded Goran Ivanisevic of Croatia was beaten 6737 dashnum dashnum by unseeded Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden 
Other seeded players advancing were number three Wayne Ferreira of South Africa number four Marcelo Rios of Chile number six MaliVai Washington of the United States and American Todd Martin the seventh seeed

Philippoussis saved a match point at dashnum in the thirdset tie break before winning dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum 
Philippoussis s compatriot 13th seed Jason Stoltenberg was not as fortunate 
He held one match point at dashnum in a marathon thirdset tie break but was beaten dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum by unseeded Daniel Vacek of the Czech Republic 
I knew I had to serve well and keep the points short and that s what I was able to do said Nestor who ranks 10th in doubles 
There were only two service breaks in the match 
The lanky Canadian broke Muster at dashnum in the first set and dashnum in the second before ending the match on his third match point when the Austrian hit a service return long 
I probably did nt hit five ground strokes in the whole match said Muster only partly joking 
The way he was chipping and charging and serving and volleying I did nt really get my timing playing from the baseline 
He played a good match took a few chances and every time he was down he was able to come up with a big first serve 
Playing at night was not Muster s preference 
I asked for a day match and they gave me a night match he said 
I do nt like playing under the lights but maybe it would not have made any difference 
Ivanisevic rallied from a dashnum deficit in the first set but then played erratically against the 44thranked Tillstrom who was a surprise winner over his famous compatriot Stefan Edberg in the second round at Wimbledon 
Ivanisevic hit num aces but was outplayed from the back court by the 24yearold Tillstrom 
The sixthranked Ivanisevic who lost in the final at Indianapolis to world number one Pete Sampras of the US last Sunday made a quick getaway after his loss but did say Something was not there when I arrived in Toronto 
I did nt feel good 
And I did nt have a good feeling as soon as I lost in my doubles on Tuesday 
I thought he looked a little unfocused at certain times on his ground strokes said Tillstrom 
The 19yearold Philippoussis who beat Sampras in the third round of this year s Australian Open stayed calm in a nervy thirdset tie break against Rosset 
I m pleased because I did nt play that great today but I fought really well he said 
When I was down dashnum in the tiebreak in the third set I just thought about winning my two serves and hoped that he might get tight 
Then he shanked a forehand at to make it 5all and that helped me back

They made me sign an undertaking not to sell the books to anyone at the risk of legal action 
One official told me you have to either destroy the books or return them to Amman Daoud Makkawi owner of the Nablusbased alRisala bookshop told Reuters 
He said ministry officials made him sign this a few weeks ago after he brought about a dozen copies from Jordan of a book by Edward Said a prominent scholar at New York City s Columbia University 
Said a US citizen of Palestinian origin has been an outspoken critic of the year IsraeliPLO selfrule deal and has written at least two books on the accord

There is no strategy to ban books or to suppress freedom of expression in any form whatsoever Taha told Reuters

This may explain some mistakes against some journalists and writers he said

I think this is a bad beginning

Defiant US neoNazi jailed by German court 
Andrew Gray 
HAMBURG Germany dashnum 
A Hamburg court sentenced US neoNazi leader Gary Lauck on Thursday to four years in prison for pumping banned extremist propaganda into Germany from his base in the United States 
Lauck from Lincoln Nebraska yelled a tirade of abuse at the court after his conviction for inciting racial hatred 
The struggle will go on the 43yearold shouted in German before being escorted out by security guards 
Lauck s lawyer vowed he would appeal against the court s decision arguing that his client should have been set free because he had not committed any offence under German law 
The German government hailed the conviction as a major victory in the fight against neoNazism 
Lauck s worldwide network has been the main source of antiSemitic propaganda material flowing into Germany since the 1970s 
Lauck possessed a welloiled propaganda machine honed during more than num years presiding judge Guenter Bertram told the court 
He set up a propaganda cannon and fired it at Germany 
said Bertram who also read out extracts from Lauck s material praising Hitler as the greatest of all leaders and describing the Nazi slaughter of millions of Jews as a myth 
Eager to put Lauck behind bars quickly and avoid a long and complex trial prosecutor Bernd Mauruschat limited his charges to offences since year 
He had demanded a fiveyear jail term but said he was satisfied with the court s sentence 
Publishing and distributing neoNazi material is illegal in Germany but Lauck s defence team had argued that US freedom of speech laws meant he was free to produce his swastikacovered books magazines videos and flags in his homeland 
Interior Minister Manfred Kanther said in a statement he welcomed the prosecution and conviction of one of the ringleaders of international neoNazism and biggest distributers of vicious racist publications 
It is high time he was behind bars the opposition Social Democrats said in a statement 
Lauck dressed in a sober blue suit and sporting his trademark Hitleresque black moustache showed no sign of emotion as Bertram spent more than an hour reading out the verdict and explaining the court s decision 
But as Lauck was about to be led away he turned to reporters and blurted out a virtually incomprehensible quickfire diatribe against the court 
Neither the National Socialists Nazis nor the communists dared to kidnap an American citizen he shouted in an oblique reference to his extradition to Germany from Denmark 
That s the truth 
His attorney HansOtto Sieg told reporters outside the courtroom that the judges had not explained how a German court could judge someone for actions carried out in the United States 
Bertram said Lauck was obsessed by Nazism and devoted his life to leading his National Socialist German Workers Party Foreign Organisation NSDAPAO which derives its name from the full German title of Hitler s Nazi party 
During the threemonth trial the court dealt mainly with issues of the NSDAPAO s NS Kampfruf National Socialist Battle Cry magazine filled with references to Aryan supremacy and defamatory statements about Jews 
The court rejected Sieg s argument that Lauck s extradition from Denmark where he was arrested in March last year at the request of German authorities was illegal 
Lauck was also convicted of disseminating the symbols of anticonstitutional organisations 
He will probably be free in around two and a half years 
The court ruled that the num months he has spent in custody since his arrest should be subtracted from his prison term

India said on Thursday that its opposition to a global nuclear test ban treaty did not mean New Delhi intended to enter into an arms race with neighbouring Pakistan and China 
Foreign Minister IK Gujral was asked at a news conference if India s decision to block adoption of the accord in Geneva would lead to an arms race with Pakistan and China 
I do nt see that possibility because India is not entering into any arms race he said 
Our not signing a new treaty does not mean we are going in for any new kind of weapons particularly nuclear 
China along with Britain France Russia and the United States is a declared nuclear power 
India carried out a nuclear test in year but says it has not built the bomb 
Experts believe both India and Pakistan could quickly assemble nuclear weapons 
Gujral said he did not expect India s veto of the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT to damage bilateral ties with other nations 
I do not visualise its straining our bilateral relations with any country 
The text has already been blocked he said 
Gujral said India would reexamine its position if the treaty particularly a clause providing for its entry into force was modified 
Asked what India would do if the pact were forwarded to the United Nations General Assembly Gujral said That bridge I will cross when I come to it 
In a written statement released at the news conference Gujral reiterated India s objections to the treaty under negotiation at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva 
It is a sad fact that the nuclear weapon states show no interest in giving up their nuclear hegemony the statement said 
Gujral said India had national security concerns that made it impossible for New Delhi to sign the CTBT 
Our security concerns oblige us to maintain our nuclear option he said adding that India had exercised restraint in not carrying out any nuclear tests since the country s lone test blast in year 
He said We cannot accept constraints on our option as long as nuclear weapon states continue to rely on their nuclear arsenals for their security

Ukraine hails peace as marks fiveyear independence

Ukraine celebrates five years of independence from Kremlin rule on Saturday hailing civil and interethnic peace as its main postSoviet achievement 
Ukraine s declaration of independence in year backed ninetoone by a referendum in December of that year effectively dealt a death blow to the Soviet empire and ended more than three centuries of rule from Moscow 
Ukraine with a Russian community of num million people the world s largest outside Russia has avoided conflicts like those in Russia s Chechnya neighbouring Moldova and the former Soviet republics of Georgia Azerbaijan and Tajikistan 
Ukraine s biggest achievements for five years are the preservation of civil peace and interethnic harmony President Leonid Kuchma said in televised statement this week 
Unlike many other postSoviet countries we were able to deal with conflict situations in a peaceful and civilised way 
But independence was initially accompanied by hyperinflation and economic collapse although there are signs of a turnaround 
Inflation a hyperinflationary num percent a year in year was a respectable num percent a month in June and July and the economy has just begun to grow 
Kuchma told a solemn ceremony at the Ukraina Palace on Friday that there was a turning point in reforms and that he expected a rise in the standard of living in the near future 
There is no doubt that economic growth has already started said Adelbert Knobl head of the International Monetary Fund s mission in Ukraine 
The national bank and the government have every reason to be proud of their efforts 
Central bank officials said on Thursday that a muchpostponed hryvna currency would definitely be introduced before the end of this year 
It will replace the interim karbovanets currency which was introduced at par to the Russian rouble in year but now trades at almost num karbovanets per rouble 
Ukraine has repeatedly promised to introduce the hryvna but had to postpone the plans because of economic problems 
Proud of its record in promptly joining both the Council of Europe and NATO s Partnership for Peace Ukraine caused a foreign policy wrangle this week offending China by allowing a Taiwanese minister to appear on a public if unofficial visit 
China cancelled a visit by a toplevel delegation in protest 
Kiev s Foreign Minister Hennady Udovenko said Beijing was overreacting 
But Ukraine seeing itself as a bridge between Russia and the rapidly Westernising countries of eastern Europe is looking West as well as East 
The strategic aim of European integration should not in any way damage Ukraine s interests in postSoviet areas 
Relations with Russia which is our main partner have great importance Kuchma said 
But Ukraine cannot be economically oriented on Russia even though those in some circles push us to do that 
Kuchma has said Kiev wants membership of the European Union associate membership of the Western European Union defence grouping and to move closer to NATO 
A message from the West this week from US President Bill Clinton congratulated Ukraine on the anniversary promising to support market reforms and praising Ukraine as a stabilising factor in a united Europe

Russia to clamp down on barter deals 
MOSCOW dashnum 
Russian officials keen to cut capital flight will adopt tight measures to cut barter deals in foreign trade to a minimum a customs official said on Friday 
We have always been concerned about barter deals with other countries viewing them as a disguised kind of capital flight from Russia Marina Volkova deputy head of the currency department at the State Customs Committee told Reuters 
Volkova said last year goods had been exported under many Russian barter deals with nothing imported in return 
She said the cost of such unimported goods was num billion in year 
Barter deals were worth num billion last year or about eight percent of all Russian exports estimated at num billion she said 
The cost of exported goods is too often understated so the actual share of barter deals in Russian exports and the amount of unimported goods may be even higher Volkova said 
A few days ago Russian President Boris Yeltsin issued a decree on state regulation of foreign barter deals and Volkova said this could substantially improve the situation 
In line with the decree which will come into force on November num all Russian barter traders will be obliged to import goods worth the cost of their exports within num days 
If traders are late they will have to pay fines worth the cost of their exported goods Volkova said 
Understating the cost of exported goods could still be a loophole for barter dealers but Volkova said the authorities are currently tackling the technicalities of the issue 
Barter has always been a feature of the Soviet Union s foreign trade but Yeltsin s decrees liberalising foreign trade in dashnum has given barter a new impetus 
A few years ago barter deals accounted for up to dashnum percent of Russian exports because thousands of trade companies which popped up preferred barter in the absence of reliable Russian banks and money transfer systems Volkova said 
Now many Russian banks are strong and can make various sorts of money tranfers while incompetent traders are being ousted by more experienced ones 
But the current share of barter deals in Russian exports is still high she said

Martin overcame Cedric Pioline of France dashnum dashnum dashnum and OBrien beat Mikael Tillstrom of Sweden dashnum dashnum dashnum 
If you really look at the match said the 12thranked Washington after losing to the 70thranked Rafter I never really got a chance to play because he was serving big and getting in close to the net 
He was also able to handle my serve pretty easily because my first service percentage was only in the 40s 
Put those two things together and you get a loss 
Rafter missed num weeks after wrist surgery earlier this year and the time away from tennis has given him a new perspective 
Before when I was on tour I always felt I had to be in bed by time or num oclock and I had to be up at a certain time Rafter said 
Now I can go to bed at at midnight or wake up at seven in the morning 
I just do nt have as many set routines and it s made me a happier person 
Martin was pleased with his victory over Pioline his first in five meetings with the 11thranked Frenchman 
It s always difficult to win a match when you lose the first set especially against someone you have never beaten he said 
I got more aggressive in the second and third sets and the wind picked up and that also affected things because Cedric definitely went off a little bit 
The 26yearold OBrien who won the ATP Tour stop in New Haven last week has now won num of his last num matches dating back to qualifying rounds in Los Angeles in late July 
He ranks 76th after being 285th four weeks ago 
I feel I m hitting the ball well even though I m having more mental letdowns than I did last week OBrien said 
But I m still competing well 
I got a lot of first serves in said Enqvist about his victory over Korda 
I did nt miss that many shots and he was making the mistakes 
Still marvelling at an exciting 64stroke rally he won in the last game of his secondround match against Javier Sanchez of Spain on Tuesday Enqvist joked Today against Petr there were about num strokes in the whole match

Under the agreement which followed talks in Miami this week AMR also will be allowed to shift up to four of the weekly flights it now operates between Miami and Colombia to its New York gateway 
The United States also will be able to designate one new allcargo carrier for service between the two nations after two years 
Colombia was permitted to add a single additional roundtrip flight to its current New York service although it will not be able to do so while under Category Two Conditional status under the Federal Aviation Administration s International Aviation Safety program 
Colombia would be allowed to add new service when its safety assessment has been improved the department said 
With the exception of the new services just agreed to the governments of the two nations have agreed to maintain their current level of routes and airlines for the next 212 years the agreement said 
The agreement resolved a dispute that arose in June when Colombia turned down American s request to operate flights between New York and Bogota a denial that prompted the United States to charge that the Colombians were breaking a bilateral aviation agreement and to propose sanctions against one of two Colombian airlines Avianca and ACES

Soccer Arab team breaks new ground in Israel

TAIBE Israel dashnum 
For the first time in Israeli history an Arab team will take the field when the National League soccer season starts on Saturday 
Hapoel Taibe fields four Jewish players and two foreign imports a Pole and a Romanian 
The rest of the side is made up mainly of Moslem Arabs 
The club founded in year has a loyal following in Taibe an Arab town of num in the heart of Israel 
But away from their home ground they face unfriendly crowds who taunt the players with racist abuse 
The very first thing we thought about after we knew we would be promoted was the game against Betar Jerusalem said Taibe supporter Karem Haj Yihye 
Two weeks ago Taibe coached by Pole Wojtek Lazarek met Betar a club closely associated with the rightwing Likud party for the first time in a Cup match in Jerusalem 
Chants from the crowd of Death to the Arabs and bottlethrowing during the game marred the match which ended in a goalless draw 
One Taibe supporter required hospital treatment for cuts and bruises after a stone struck his head as he was driving from the stadium 
We re used to hearing the taunts of Death to the Arabs said Sameh Haj Yihye a Taibe resident who studies at Jerusalem s Hebrew University 
But we know that these are only words nobody has died from hearing them and it only makes us support our team more vehemently 
The dusty town of Taibe lacks the amenities of Jewish communities and many Israeli Arabs have long complained of state discrimination 
There are no parks or empty areas of land around here so when we want to play a friendly game of soccer we all load up in the car and travel to Tel Aviv num km num miles away Sameh Haj Yihye said 
The town s ramshackle 2500seat ground is accessible only by two dirt tracks 
We plan to build a 10000seat stadium but it may well be situated elsewhere said club chairman Abdul Rahman Haj Yihye 
We will discuss this with the mayor and hopefully a new or refurbished ground will be completed by the start of the new year 
In the meantime Taibe will play all their heavily policed home matches at the Jewish coastal town of Netanya 
We are Israelis there is no question about that said Karem Haj Yihye a hotel waiter 
We do nt have any connection with the Palestinians they live over there he said pointing to the West Bank seven km four miles to the east 
We do nt feel our club represents Palestinian Arabs said club chairman Abdul Rahman 
We are trying to do all we can to run a professional outfit we are pleased at any support we get but do not go out looking to represent the whole Arab world

Jordan expels Iraqi diplomat after bread riots

AMMAN dashnum 
Jordan which has blamed Iraq for bread riots last week has asked an Iraqi diplomat to leave official and diplomatic sources said on Friday 
The main Friday prayers in southern Jordan that were the starting point for the riots a week ago passed peacefully under tight security imposed by the army with only brief demonstrations reported 
Adel Ibrahim the Iraqi embassy s press attache was asked to leave because he was carrying out duties incompatible with diplomatic norms one source told Reuters implying he was accused of spying 
Ibrahim told Reuters by telephone from his embassy office in Amman that he had not been notified of any explusion order 
The government declined official comment 
Ibrahim s assistant Hussein Khalaf was expelled earlier this year for similar reasons amid rising tension in bilateral ties after King Hussein began calling for change in Baghdad following top Iraqi defections in August year 
Iraq retaliated then by expelling a junior administrator working in the Jordanian embassy in Baghdad but has continued its policy of trying to avoid public conflicts with Jordan its only secure route to the rest of the world 
Jordan has accused Iraq and a local proBaghdad party for the country s worst unrest in seven years which erupted after it almost doubled the prices of bread last week under radical economic reforms agreed with the International Monetary Fund 
In Karak where two days of riots flared last Friday a few hundred young men lingered outside Omari mosque on leaving shouting slogans for about num minutes 
Disperse abstain from forming groups and help maintain order army officers who has enforced a loose curfew since the riots told the crowd through loudspeakers 
The men shouted Allahu Akbar God is Greatest as a former Islamist deputy Ahmed Kafawin told soldiers the crowd would not cause trouble 
He had earlier mounted the mosque s pulpit to demand release of detainees an end to raids on houses and the cancelling of the bread price rises 
Armoured cars had patrolled streets in Karak traditional bastion of communist ideology and Baath socialism that swept the region in the 1950s and guarded entrances to the hilltop city famed for its Crusader castle before the prayers 
There was also heavy security in the crowded centre of Amman where smaller clashes had erupted last Saturday but Friday prayers at the main mosque ended quietly as police in full riot gear looked on 
The Jordanian Arab Socialist Baath Party which has one deputy in the 80seat lower house of parliament has denied involvement in unrest which it blamed on government policies and rising economic hardship 
Government attempts to link the rioting to foreign influence has been treated with derision by those in the streets who blame the protests on severe economic hardships

Implied volatility of European bond and interest rate options should stabilise around current levels until early next week after falling before and after this week s Germanled cut in interest rates traders said 
Volatility has come off a lot 
We re looking for it to stabilise now said one Euromark options trader at a US bank 
A trader at a Japanese bank said Euromark volatility now stood at num for September contract num for December num for March and num for June 
This compared with midweek levels before the welter of interest rate cuts of num for September num for December num for March and num for June he said 
At num GMT December Euromark futures were trading at num two basis points down on the day 
He said the selloff in June vols might have been overdone which could offer value at current levels 
He said caps and floors would be well bid after the round of interest rate cuts due to the fact these rates should stay low at the short end 
The size of the Bundesbank s repo rate cut to num percent from num percent took markets by surprise 
Volatility has a bid to it longerdated volatility more than shortdated because the event people were buying for has passed and now perhaps people will sell some short dated vol and buy some long dated vol he said 
Long dated volatility has been low this year so it is still at levels which are not historically high 
It is not a dangerous level to own vol You are not going to lose a lot and you could make quite a bit 
He said volatility levels should be stable until markets reassess the situation after a long weekend in Britain 
Paribas Capital Markets OTC options specialist Robert Coughlan said that if volatility continued lower for the rest of Friday in overthecounter 10year Bunds it should be higher next Tuesday 
He said the absence on holiday of many market makers was a main factor behind falls this week in volatility in highyielding markets such as Italy Spain and Sweden 
Coughlan said the market had more downside than upside potential but a fall was not likely to be of significant size 
I recommend people sell strangles in a number of markets in Germany and France in particular 
With highyielding markets Italy will be a lot more vulnerable in September on economic and political fronts so I would use current the low level of vol to buy options 
So sell options on Bunds and France to enhance yield and buy options on Italy Coughlan said

The announcement of the contract for num million settop boxes gave new hope to Zenith which has struggled with years of losses 
This really indicates we re back in the business William Luehrs president of the Glenview Illbased company s Networks Services Division said in a telephone interview 
Anytime somebody gets the opportunity to enter the next era with such a big bang has got to be seen as a strong message to the industry 
Following the announcement Zenith s stock soared num to num on the New York Stock Exchange

We ll build a lot of these devices into television sets for digital television he said 
Although that is not where this particular contract is headed the fact that there is a strong Zenith presence will pay us dividends in the future

Huge Windows num sales fail to meet expectations 
Martin Wolk 
SEATTLE dashnum 
A year after its massively publicized introduction Microsoft Corp s Windows num computer operating system has fallen short of the most optimistic expectations for the software giant and the industry 
Even though more than num million copies of Windows num have been sold making it the fastestselling new software ever it would have been impossible for any product to live up to the unprecedented hype of the Aug num year launch when stores around the world opened at midnight to greet long lines of customers 
The Redmond Washbased company spent tens of millions of dollars promoting the product with stunts that included buying the entire print run of the Times of London and lighting New York s Empire State building in a Windows color scheme 
But the product delivered eight months late has fallen short of its sales potential in part because Microsoft delivered a mixed message to business customers analysts said 
It did nt do as well as it could have said Rob Enderle an analyst with Giga Information Group 
Scores of software and hardware companies that had hoped for a big boost in sales were disappointed when only a brief spike materialized 
People who were expecting major coattails were somewhat disappointed said Scott Winkler an analyst with Gartner Group 
It s not as though it has nt had an impact he said 
It just has nt had the huge earthshattering impact some people were looking for 
Symantec Corp which had been among the most bullish of software companies at the time of the Windows num launch ended up posting disappointing financial results when retail sales of the operating system fell short of its projections 
Touchstone Software Corp had to pay num million in cash and stock to settle a shareholders lawsuit brought after the company s sales failed to meet expectations tied to the Windows num launch 
Many software developers apparently saw their crucial holiday season sales suffer last year because store shelves were jammed with blueandwhite boxes of Windows num resulting in a shortage of space for seasonal products said Ann Stephens president of PC Data Inc 
To be sure sales of Windows num and the accompanying Office num upgrade drove Microsoft sales up num percent last year to a record num billion and cemented the company s status as the industry s dominant company 
Microsoft executives say they are thrilled with the sales figures and industry analysts estimate that by sometime next year the installed base of Windows num will surpass that of the older version of Windows now used on about num million computers worldwide 
But Enderle said the figure could have been even higher if Microsoft had done a better job of handling the huge demand for technical support from customers who were frustrated trying to install the system 
He and other analysts said corporate America adopted a goslow approach because Microsoft already was promoting the new version of its highend Windows NT operating system expected to be available in stores in the next several weeks 
Microsoft sent a lot of signals that NT was going to be the answer Winkler said 
Many people began to believe that Windows num was being downplayed 
But now that Windows NT num has been launched Winkler and others believe only a relatively small proportion of corporate users will elect to pay the added software and hardware costs needed to use it instead of Windows num 
Windows num is going to do great he said 
The mistake people made was in thinking it was going to be a fast sweeping change rather than a slow building change

The United States said on Thursday it remained committed to migration accords with Cuba and would continue to repatriate intercepted Cuban migrants who attempted to enter US territory illegally

The United States reiterates its full commitment to the implementation of the accords signed by the two countries in year and year said the statement by spokesman Glyn Davies 
The United States will continue to return Cuban migrants intercepted at sea who seek to enter the United States or the Guantanamo Naval Base illegally it said 
Washington would also take prompt and effective law enforcement action against alien smuggling and hijackings from Cuba it added 
Davies told reporters the statement would be distributed in the Cuban exile community in Miami to remind everyone of the importance of abiding by the accords and avoiding dangerous attempts to cross the straits from Cuba to Florida 
Havana s complaints centred on an incident in which a boatload of emigrants capsized in the Florida Straits last week and two recent aircraft hijackings from Cuba 
Sixteen of those picked up from the boat were returned to Cuba but eight were taken to the United States and three to Guantanamo Bay a US base on Cuba until they emigrated to another nation 
The most recent hijacking last Friday involved three hijackers and the pilot of a small aircraft 
Davies said on Tuesday the pilot could soon return to Cuba but US authorities planned to try the hijackers

Sea lion paparazzi to keep tabs on whales 
LONDON dashnum 
US marine biologists have trained a pair of sea lions to tag and photograph elusive whales as they cruise through the Pacific depths New Scientist magazine reported on Thursday 
James Harvey and Jennifer Hurley of the Moss Landing Marine Laboratories in California say their sea lions natural companions of many species of whale can go where no man or woman has ever gone before 
Any diver knows that when a whale gets going you ca nt keep up Harvey told the magazine 
That is why we know only about five percent of what whales do 
The sea lions 17yearold Beaver and nineyearold Sake have undergone six years of training for their mission 
Beaver once worked for the US Navy and Sake is an amusement park veteran 
Harvey said they could accurately tag whales with a radio transmitter and could also swim all the way around one of the giant mammals filming it with a video camera 
Their first assignment later this year will be documenting humpback whale migration off Monterey California 
The article did not spell out exactly how the sea lions manage to tag the whales but said in training they were taught to stick a radio transmitter on to a plastic model of a whale using suction cups

China copper stocks owned by state reserve trade 
Lynne ODonnell 
HONG KONG dashnum 
Up to num tonnes of copper held in Shanghai bonded warehouses confounding the world market as to its source and ultimate fate probably belongs to China s strategic state reserve industry sources said on Friday 
Around num tonnes of the copper have already been moved to warehouses near the northern port of Yingkou where some of the strategic stockpile was stored they said 
Just who owns the copper is a question that has kept traders and industry analysts guessing since the metal was channelled into Shanghai by the China National Nonferrous Metals Import and Export Corp CNIEC in June and July 
It was unclear whether or not the num tonnes had cleared customs which would provide some concrete indication that the strategic reserve administered directly by the central government s State Planning Commission owned the copper 
Traders have said the reserve could negotiate concessions on duties three percent import tax and num percent valueadded tax that made the copper prohibitively expensive otherwise 
But one source the head of a Hong Kong trading house said it made no difference if the copper was customs cleared or not 
If they spend all this money moving the copper to Yingkou it will be sitting there for years he said 
Once it arrives in Yingkou it is subject to monitoring by the State Planning Commission which has to give permission for any more movement it is out of the hands of traders he said 
Mystery has surrounded the Shanghai stockpile in recent months with traders unsure not only of who owns it but of its exact size and what its owner planned to do with it 
Trading sources generally agreed it would be costeffective to take the copper back into a depleted central reserve as it had already served its purpose in taking advantage of longterm backwardation on the London Metal Exchange LME 
A backwardation occurs when the spot price of a metal is higher than the forward price 
CNIEC lent around num tonnes of copper onto the LME between April and June year on behalf of the state reserve running the state stockpile down to num tonnes from num tonnes previously 
Traders in Asia said CNIEC could well have lent it to the market at around US num a tonne and then paid somewhere between num and num a tonne when it started taking the metal back earlier this year 
This would have cleared CNIEC a healthy profit which could then have been used to finance storage and other costs 
Word that CNIEC had offered the copper to European trading houses in a series of secret meetings unnerved an already jittery market 
Industry analysts Bloomsbury Minerals Economics BME said on Wednesday the motivation of the owners of the num tonnes whoever they are is the most important shortterm fundamental in an already tight world market 
BME repeated in its latest review rumours of involvement by Sumitomo Corp with CNIEC said to be helping the Japanese trader unload its copper positions after it revealed in June losses of num billion in a decade of unauthorised deals 
Sumitomo and CNIEC have made no comments on the talk and Chinese traders said they know nothing of such an arrangement 
Traders in Shanghai said on Thursday they were unaware of movements out of the Shanghai bonded warehouses 
They reported more arrivals that were probably spot purchases 
They also expressed concern that the tonnage in bonded warehouses would move onto the domestic market 
But these concerns were irrelevant a Singapore trader said despite a forecast that domestic Chinese copper demand could hit one million tonnes this year 
As with many commodities there is a desire by the Chinese government to keep a stockpile of the metal he said 
You do nt keep it to help industry you keep it in case of emergency

Revered skull of S Africa king is Scottish woman s 
JOHANNESBURG dashnum 
A limelightloving South African chief was in disgrace on Saturday after a prized skull he brought home from Scotland was identified as belonging not to his sacred tribal ancestor but to a middleaged white woman 
A forensic scientist who examined the supposed skull of 19th century King Hintsa a chief of President Nelson Mandela s Xhosa tribe killed in battle by the British said it was in fact the cranium of a European woman 
Chief Nicholas Gcaleka dressed in animal skins and full tribal regalia journeyed to a wintry Scotland in February on a hugely publicised quest to find Hintsa s skull 
The witchdoctor said ancestors had appeared to him in a dream and ordered him to return the head said to have been carried off as a colonial trophy by the officer who shot and allegedly beheaded Hintsa after a battle in num 
But Gcaleka ran into trouble as soon as he returned to South Africa with a skull he found in a cottage in a lonely Highland forest near Inverness 
He said the spirit of a hurricane had guided him there 
Members of the Xhosa royal family branding Gcaleka a charlatan confiscated the head and sent it for tests to a forensic scientist who examined the shape of the skull and the hole that he determined had not come as supposed from a bullet 
It can be stated beyond reasonable doubt that this skull is not that of the late king the scientist said in a statement

Clinton campaign busy making news 
Laurence McQuillan 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
President Bill Clinton has served notice he intends to be busy making news or at least doing things that look and sound like it in a campaign year 
With Democrats gathering in Chicago to start a convention on Monday to nominate him for a second term as president Clinton plans a steady parade of events designed to highlight his leadership and dim the glow of the justconcluded Republican conclave that gave a boost to rival Bob Dole 
After a week of carefully orchestrated events signing into law bills passed by the Republicancontrolled Congress Clinton used his Saturday radio address to the nation to proudly announce a development in the war on crime 
Sixty days ago I directed the attorney general to draw up a plan for a national registry of sex offenders Clinton said 
That plan has now reached my desk 
Today I am pleased to announce that we are following through on our commitment to keep track of these criminals not just in a single state but wherever they go he said 
Actually creation of such a registry was underway without Clinton lifting a finger 
Attorney General Janet Reno s report all nine pages of it including footnotes offers only the interim services of the FBI until a formal registry on sex offenders has been established 
Two months ago Clinton announced he wanted an interim effort established 
Now num days later he had a chance to talk about it again 
It is an example of Clinton s strategic planning as he heads into the stretch drive for the Nov num presidential election 
Such things do not happen by chance in the Clinton White House they are part of his political chess game 
In the past week Clinton signed into law an increase in the minimium wage a bill that makes it easier for someone with a preexisting health problem to change jobs and sweeping changes overhauling the nation s welfare system 
America can look back on a week of remarkable achievement Clinton said without even a passing reference to the Republican majority in the House and Senate 
America is on the right track offering more opportunity demanding more responsibility building a stronger community the sense of shared values and stronger families he said in striking the theme of his coming week 
According to a senior campaign official Clinton will be making a lot of news in the coming week something different each day 
Clinton departs on Sunday on a fourday train trip through West Virginia Kentucky Ohio Michigan and Indiana while fellow Democrats are gathered in Chicago 
He ll make news during the day and then at night the attention will go to the convention said the campaign official 
We think it ll work really well 
Although officials decline to say just what each day s news will be the intent is to put a focus on Clinton himself and not just those attending the party s convention 
Each day of the trip will have a late start so that network television correspondents will be able to do live reports for morning programmes 
Campaign officials then hope the day s news event will be showcased on evening television news shows as a leadin for that night s convention programme 
We ll be concentrating on supporting the president as he is on the trip and making significant public policy statements related to some of his plans for the future said White House Press Secretary Mike McCurry 
McCurry said that when Clinton delivers his acceptance address on Thursday night to fellow Democrats and a national television audience he will set out a road map for the nation s future one the president hopes guides him back to the White House for four more years

A group of Italian comics hope the joke will be on separatist leader Umberto Bossi next month when they lead the ancient Etruscan town of Orvieto in a mock split from Rome 
Orvieto mayor Stefano Cimicchi said the comics including popular actor Roberto Benigni would declare Orvieto capital of Etruria on September num the day Bossi plans a march across the north in favour of independence from Rome 
We will then proceed with the annexation of Sardinia Corsica and Cyprus Cimicchi told reporters on Saturday

Orvieto located in Umbria between Rome and Florence was once the capital of Etruria an ancient federation of num Etruscan towns 
We want to pop some air out of this balloon of tension that has been blown up around September num Cimicchi said

He has recently dropped a drive for federalism saying secession from Rome s wasteful and centralised bureaucracy is the only solution for northerners

Belgium asks how paedophile suspect eluded police 
Jeremy Lovell 
BRUSSELS dashnum 
Belgian police searched two more houses on Saturday for bodies in a childsex scandal of murder kidnapping and pornography that has sent a shockwave of revulsion throughout Europe 
Recriminations built up over how the scandal s central figure convicted child rapist Marc Dutroux managed to prey on children unhindered for so long 
In just over a week two young girls have been found dead from starvation two have been freed from a dungeonlike secret compartment and an international hunt has started for at least two others 
On Saturday investigators with dogs trained to find bodies searched one house at Ransart and one at MontsurMarchienne both suburbs of the southern city of Charleroi 
Both houses are owned by Dutroux 
Belgian media speculated that Dutroux charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children must have had high level protection to molest youngsters 
They put forward no proof to support the speculation but seized on a comment by chief prosecutor Michel Bourlet on Belgian television on Friday night that he would chase down everyone involved in the case if I am allowed to 
Bourlet said between num and num paedophile porn video tapes had been seized some of which featured Dutroux 
Dutroux was charged a week ago after police rescued two young girls from a concrete dungeon in the basement of one of the six houses he owns in and around Charleroi 
Just a day later the national euphoria at the rescue turned to disgust as Dutroux led police to the bodies of two eightyearold girls in another of his houses 
Julie Lejeune and Melissa Russo had been kidnapped in June last year 
Dutroux said they starved to death nine months later 
He also admitted kidnapping two other girls An Marchal and Eefje Lambrecks a year ago 
The fate of the girls is unknown but there has been speculation they were sold into prostitution in Slovakia or the Czech Republic where Dutroux was a frequent visitor 
Belgian police have visited Bratislava and will visit Prague 
Five other people have been arrested including Dutroux s second wife Michelle Martin charged as an accomplice 
The others have been charged with abduction and illegal imprisonment of children or are suspected of criminal association 
Dutch police are also holding a 74year old Dutchman in connection with the disappearance of An and Eefje although a spokesman said no direct link had yet been established 
At least part of the speculation in the Belgian media of highlevel protection for Dutroux and his accomplices is based on leaked documents cataloguing a high degree of police bungling incompetence and indifference 
Among the revelations are the fact that the gendarmerie was running a surveillance operation codenamed Othello against Dutroux in year when both Julie and Melissa and An and Eefje were kidnapped 
They show that the gendarmes were aware that Dutroux was building cells in some of his houses for holding children yet this information was either not passed on to other police forces searching for the missing girls or was overlooked when it was 
They also show that police investigating a theft visited Dutroux late last year at the house where Julie and Melissa were being held but accepted his word that the children s cries they could hear came from neighbours 
Justice Minister Stefaan De Clerck has admitted that mistakes were made and ordered an inquiry at the same time as stressing there were no indications of a coverup 
There is also widespread disbelief that no one appeared to question how Dutroux an unemployed father of three with no visible means of support managed to own six houses

Internet Startup funded to develop Java software 
MOUNTAIN VIEW Calif dashnum 
A small team of engineers from Sun Microsystems Inc s JavaSoft unit said Sunday they have formed a new company dubbed Internet Startup to build Java infrastructure software 
The fledgling company established in a groundfloor office here over the last two weeks has received venture financing from Bessemer Venture Partners of Menlo Park Calif 
David Cowan Internet Startup founder and acting chief executive is a general partner of Bessemer 
The startup company s acting chairman is Jim Bidzos the president of RSA Data Security a unit of Security Dynamics Technologies Inc as well as chairman of VeriSign 
Internet Startup which opened its doors with about half a dozen initial employees combines experience at JavaSoft Apple Computer Inc and Oracle Systems 
Java portends dramatic changes in the way we use the Internet said Hong Bui vice president of engineering of the new company after serving as a senior engineer at JavaSoft 
Java is a computer programming language introduced by Sun Microsystems in mid1995 which has immediately captured the attention of the industry for its ability to operate across virtually all computer system in a relatively secure manner 
Just last week Sun Microsystems and the Silicon Valley venture capital giant Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers said they had completed financing of a num million fund managed by Kleiner Perkins to fund startups developing Java technologies 
Java has been licensed by nearly num organisations ranging from Microsoft Corp and International Business Machines Corp to the Taiwan government 
Prasad Wagle another former senior JavaSoft engineer who is among the founding engineers at Internet Startup said the new company aims to build software infrastructure using Java to make networked applications ubiquitious 
One feature of the Java language is that small software programmes known as applets because they are small applications can be downloaded from the server computers at the centre of networks onto individual computers for use 
In this model individual computer users can always gain access to the latest programmes and do not need to store more software than they are currently using on their computers at any one time also saving costs of memory and storage 
Chris Zuleeg a veteran of Apple and a former JavaSoft marketing manager is vice president of marketing at Internet Startup whose Web site is wwwinternetstartupcom

MOTORCYCLING JAPANESE WIN BOTH ROUND NINE SUPERBIKE RACES 
SUGO Japan dashnum 
Teenager Yuuichi Takeda racing in only his first season outclassed the big names to win the first race in round nine of the world superbike championship on Sunday 
Takeda num showed poise far beyond his years to overtake Australian Ducati rider Troy Corser last year s championship runnerup with four of the num laps left 
Honda s Takeda was pursued past Corser by the Yamaha duo of Noriyuki Haga and Wataru Yoshikawa with Haga briefly taking the lead in the final chicane on the last lap 
But Takeda found one more spurt of power to just take the flag first with Haga second and Yoshikawa third 
Haga had the consolation of recording the fastest lap at num kph 
Corser who crashed during practice on Friday limped in fourth four seconds behind Takeda with championship leader Aaron Slight of New Zealand num seconds behind the winner 
In the second race Takeda again challenged strongly until the fifth lap from the end when he crashed while running second to eventual race winner Takuma Aoki 
Aoki the elder brother of reigning 125cc world champion Haruchika had a racelong duel with John Kocinski of the United States on a Ducati before taking the chequered flag 
Kocinski led for the early laps before he was passed first by Aoki who recorded the fastest lap of num kph and then by Takeda 
With Takeda out of the race Kocinski regained second place but he could not overtake Aoki 
Haga again was the unlucky rider finishing third ahead of Slight with Corser in 10th place 
But the strong showing by the Japanese riders did not alter the championship table with Slight still leading on num points followed by Corser with num and Kocinski with num

Chris Lewis did his best to forget his controversial omission from the England oneday squad on Sunday but could not prevent Pakistan reasserting their dominance in the final test at The Oval

The solitary wicket to fall was Asif Mujtaba run out for num attempting a second run to third man where Lewis was lurking with a point to prove 
There seemed scant danger until the Surrey player swooped on to the ball and returned off balance to county team mate Alec Stewart who whipped off the bails 
Lewis though could not make similar waves with the ball as Salim Malik and Wasim Akram batted through the rest of the session with few alarms 
Wasim rattled along to num not out outscoring his partner who was unbeaten on num at the break although the weather was again threatening to play the dominant role 
Rain arrived just as the players left the field for lunch forcing the groundstaff into action yet again

SOCCER CHAMPIONS PORTO KICK OFF SEASON WITH A DRAW 
LISBON dashnum 
Portuguese champions Porto kicked off the season with a disappointing dashnum home draw against Setubal and were lucky to squeeze in an equaliser in extra time 
Porto who are fighting to take their third consecutive title this season were dashnum down until the 86th minute when a header by Mario Jardel found the net after a string of missed opportunities including a penalty taken by top league scorer Domingos Oliveira in the 60th minute 
Domingos redeemed himself by netting the equaliser just into extra time

He was substituted by Paulao 
Benfica finally opened the scoring in the 81st minute with a penalty taken by Helder after Luis Baltasar tripped up captain Joao Pinto under the referee s nose 
Braga defender Idalecio gave his team their equaliser seven minutes from the final whistle with a header into the back of the net

SOCCER FIORENTINA WIN WITH BATISTUTA DOUBLE 
MILAN dashnum 
Argentine striker Gabriel Batistuta gave Fiorentina the perfect 70th birthday present on Sunday with two goals that gave the Italian Cup winners a dashnum Supercup victory over serie A champions Milan 
The victory coming on the eve of the founding of the Florence club in year also marked the first time since the preseason trophy between the Cup winners and league champions was started in year that the Cup winners had won 
Batistuta gave Fiorentina the lead in the 11th minute 
Sweden s Stefan Schwarz picked him out with a lob to the edge of the box and Batistuta did the rest chipping veteran defender Franco Baresi and scoring at the near post 
Montenegrin midfielder Dejan Savicevic equalised for the home team weaving past a defender checking and firing in a leftfooted shot in the 21st minute that gave young Fiorentina goalkeeper Francesco Toldo little chance 
The scored stayed level to the final minutes but with a penalty shoot out looming Batistuta took charge 
French international midfielder Marcel Desailly fouled the Argentine whose coach at Boca Juniors before he joined Fiorentina in year was new Milan coach Oscar Tabarez and Batistuta rammed home the free kick from num metres out 
The 83rd minute shot curling over the defence and dipping in under the bar from the striker dubbed Batigol by adoring Fiorentina fans was just reward for Fiorentina who looked a far more impressive team 
Milan s player of the year George Weah missed a good first half opportunity but otherwise looked a little rusty while Italian team mate Roberto Baggio did not play due to injury 
New Dutch signing Edgar Davids came on late in the second half as a Milan substitute but made little impact

Most of the test num who beat the Springboks dashnum to secure New Zealand s firstever rugby series in South Africa stood in the middle of the empty 50000seat Loftus Versfeld

The maul was there and I was going to go in but I thought I should hold off because we had the ball 
When halfback Justin Marshall got the ball he was going to go on the openside where Jon Preston was so I emptied my lung at him to get the ball this way 
I just hit through and I was punching the air before the ball got there 
It cost me a few bucks at the bar 

The decision to attempt a dropped goal was a spontaneous one Brooke said 
It was just like the World Cup the ball came and the chance was there 

Centre Frank Bunce said he had never felt so exhausted during a match 
We were gutted and there was nowhere to hide they just kept coming at you he said 
I was gone in the first num minutes completely exhausted but you had no choice 
There was just so much riding on it 
It s amazing just how big this ground was yesterday

South Africa yet to hear from apartheid enforcers 
Anton Ferreira 
CAPE TOWN dashnum 
South Africa s truth commission begins issuing subpoenas this week in a bid to dig beneath the political rationales and find the sinister figures who have the blood of the country s race war on their hands 
Leaders of the major parties involved from rightwing whites to radical blacks appeared before Archbishop Desmond Tutu s Truth and Reconciliation Commission last week to paint the broad picture of their actions for or against apartheid 
Most including former president FW de Klerk and African National Congress Deputy President Thabo Mbeki offered apologies for any mistakes they had made and accepted broad responsibility for the actions of their foot soldiers 
But none named those guilty of ordering or carrying out any of the gross violations of human rights which Tutu is investigating 
Human rights lawyer Brian Currin said the hearings last week were not intended as a form of confessional and that those who personally committed crimes during apartheid would testify only before a separate arm of the commission the amnesty committee 
I do nt think one should have expected more than what one got he said 
That was not the amnesty committee where perpetrators are expected to open their hearts and souls and to tell it all 
The commission which has the power to grant amnesty to those who confess to abuses has begun hearing the testimony from people already in jail for their deeds 
But others such as selfconfessed secret police hitsquad leader Dirk Coetzee have yet to testify 
Tutu s deputy chairman Alex Boraine told reporters the commission would begin issuing subpoenas to suspects who refused to appear voluntarily some time this week 
He added that former hardline apartheid president PW Botha could be among those called 
But Currin who is advising several people regarded as perpetrators said this was not the best way to achieve the commission s aims 
A person can be forced to appear but the only way one is going to get to the truth in its totality is if people feel it is a good idea to go to the amnesty committee 
At the moment this is not the case 
He cited Coetzee who was charged with murder after confessing in media interviews to dirty tricks 
His trial is due to start in December but the truth commission intends to decide on his amnesty application before that 
Currin said the law had to be changed so all judicial prosecutions were automatically suspended for those who approached the truth commission 
Last week s submissions to the commission by the ANC de Klerk s National Party and the rightwing Freedom Front of General Constand Viljoen left many South Africans unsatisfied 
Boraine said the picture was incomplete because officers of the apartheidera security forces had yet to make their scheduled separate submission but one black caller to a radio talk show declared 
This whole thing is utterly useless it does nt help us at all 
What the people expect is to have houses to have jobs 
Political scientist Jannie Gagiano said he doubted that the National Party which implemented apartheid in year and began dismantling it in year felt it carried a burden of guilt and needed to be exculpated through the commission 
Therefore I have some doubts about achieving some form of reconciliation 
One has to feel a bit guilty to feel the need for reconciling yourself to a historical adversary he said 
Professor Tom Lodge of the University of the Witwatersrand demurred saying 
In the irritation in the jokes in the anger that white South Africans express about the commission I think there s a moral uneasiness and I think that s healthy 
Responsibility is percolating downwards

Moslem refugees seek to vote in Serbheld town 
Samir Arnaut 
MATUZICI Bosnia dashnum 
Thousands of Moslem refugees denounced Bosnia s elections as a farce on Sunday because Serb incomers would be able to vote in their old home town cementing partition of the country 
They said they were ready to force their way back across postwar ethnic lines to Serbheld Doboj one of several towns where NATO troops fear violence involving refugees determined to vote where they once lived 
The refugees rallying in Matuzici on government territory two km from Doboj in northeast Bosnia waved banners calling the polls a farce staged by the United Nations and the European Union 
We demand to vote in Doboj other banners said 
Bosnia s Moslemled central government and many displaced Moslems are angered by a key provision of the Westernorganised September num elections allowing people to vote in postwar new places of residence 
As a result separatist Serb authorities have packed former Moslem majority towns with refugees of their own or registered other Serbs to vote there 
Critics say that what was billed as an electoral process to reintegrate Bosnia as a single multiethnic state is shaping up as a referendum on partition de facto or de jure 
Only our physical presence in Doboj will mean that the Dayton peace treaty has truly been implemented Edhem Efendija Camdzic Doboj s Islamic imaminexile told the refugees 
The main point of this rally is to highlight to the world powers what misfortune they brought upon us said Reuf Mehemdagic head of Doboj municipalityinexile 
Eleven thousand Serbs who came from elsewhere to Doboj will vote there 
How can we then expect the reintegration of Bosnia 
But no one will stop us from returning to our homes 
Mirhunisa Komarica a government refugee official said We want to vote where we were thrown out from 
This is a protest of warning and the next step is entering our town using all means possible so let them shoot 
Bosnian Vice President Ejup Ganic a Moslem told the refugees We have a message for the Serbs who are now in our homes not to plan the future of their children there because there will be no good fortune in that 
To loud applause he added We will enter Doboj untie the Doboj knot and ensure free movement for all 
We have to enter Doboj to free the Serbs from their own separatist politics 
The Dayton peace accords guaranteed refugees the right to return to their homes and ensured freedom of movement across ethnic lines 
But local police controlled by nationalist parties in Moslem Serb and Croat sectors of Bosnia and civilian mobs have turned ceasefire lines into virtually impassable borders 
The majority of refugees from Bosnia s dashnum war are Moslems from the Serbcontrolled north and east 
NATOled peace troops beefed up their presence in the Doboj area on Sunday to deter any sudden emotional attempt by the refugees to cross the InterEntity Boundary Line into Doboj 
But the crowd dispersed without incident 
Moslems and Serbs have scuffled several times along the line in the past when Moslem refugees tried to surge into the town

MEXICO CITY dashnum 
The leftist Popular Revolutionary Army EPR in a published report on Sunday said it operated throughout Mexico including the capital and denied government assertions it was isolated to one state 
Commanders Vicente and Oscar guarded by a dozen EPR gunmen said in an interview with La Jornada outside Mexico City that the armed group was committed to overthrowing the government 
They government officials want to present us before public opinion as a local problem as just being from Guerrero and as irrational radicals Commander Oscar told La Jornada 
They said the ERP whose fighters first appeared wearing military fatigues and brandishing assault rifles in the southwestern state of Guerrero on June num had a 23000strong membership but this could not be confirmed independently 
La Jornada also reported on Sunday that the Mexican Army has discovered a 37page EPR manual detailing guerrilla tactics and strategies 
It quoted the manual as saying The objective of the Basic Course on War is to provide for combatants of the EPR basic military knowledge for the armed conflict against the police and military apparatus of the bourgeoisie 
It was the second time armed commanders of the EPR have granted interviews outside Guerrero state an extremely poor and volatile region where leftist protesters often have clashed violently with authorities 
Unlike the better known and unrelated Zapatista rebels in southeastern Chiapas state the EPR has never taken on the army in direct combat according to official reports

This finding is important because one of the jars still contains substances and materials used in the conservation of mummies and the conservation of the intestines and all the things which were in the cavity of a person we have not identified yet Saleh said

Corporate America taking new view on compensation 
Anne Murray 
NEW YORK dashnum 
Corporate America is planning major changes in employee compensation in the next few years according to a recent study 
What it comes down to is this If you re highly skilled you ll benefit nicely 
But if you re not and cannot contribute to your employer s goals you ll be paid less 
The survey conducted in late year and the early part of this year by management consulting firm Towers Perrin showed that the focus will be on an employee s overall value to the company s bottom line rather than how well an employee performs a specific task 
Presently for example if an accountant s job involves doing five specific tasks he or she can expect a certain salary said Sandra ONeal a Towers Perrin principal 
In the future the accountant will be evaluated solely on knowledge skill and abilities she said 
In addition to using accounting skills the accountant will also have to be creative work well in a team be sensitive to customer needs and set productivity goals 
The good news is if you re highly skilled and have many abilities you ll be paid more said ONeal 
The bad news is if you re not skilled and ca nt contribute to a team to customer service and the organisation s goals you ll be paid less 
Of the num midtolarge size corporations surveyed num percent had undergone a major restructuring in the last three years and more than twothirds reported that productivity and profits were up as result 
Next on the agenda for these firms is developing a new compensation structure and num percent report that they are considering a new skillsbased plan for both management and nonmanagement employees 
This coming shift ONeal said is not just isolated or a fad 
It s an inexorable change 
After World War II corporations adopted a military model creating hierarchical organisations where the concept of defined tasks worked great she said 
But as the economy became global customers were more demanding and problems became more complex 
Multilayers kept management at a distance from its customers ONeal said 
Now organisations must change to stay competitive 
ONeal says firms will place a greater emphasis on teams and team performance in giving raises 
If your team does well you ll do well 
If it does nt do well do nt expect a raise 
Is this fair to an employee who can go the distance but is on a team that ca nt keep up 
That s an important question we used to ask a lot said ONeal 
It s not a question we ask any more 
The more important question is Do we have results 

To get those results num percent of the companies surveyed plan to eliminate base pay increases in favour of cash bonuses and incentives such as employee and team award programmes and education 
Companies that can change their culture and view employees as business partners will do well ONeal said 
For example the survey rated some participants in the survey as highperforming companies based on their return on equity above num percent 
Those companies also said they already offer employees variable pay and business education give their managers more control over pay decisions and celebrate employee and team success 
They respect employees more they trust employees more and they value their employees more ONeal said 
The key to success at highperformance companies is engaging employees in a business partnership 
It will improve a company s bottom line

FEATURE Fertile Ukraine faces drought of cash and rain 
Irene Marushko 
BATKIVSHCHYNA COLLECTIVE FARM Ukraine dashnum 
Four shiny new greenandyellow John Deere combines parked at this 1750hectare 4325acre farm in the graingrowing regions south of Kiev do nt fill its chief agronomist with enthusiasm 
They did a good job this year but they need good diesel and good engine oil said Ivan Odnosum 
God help us if there is a breakdown he said of the machinery loaned to the farm after the Ukrainian government bought it earlier this year 
The country s grain harvest this year is forecast to fall by more than num percent to only num million tonnes and two harsh factors are to blame 
A drought scoured the steppes in May and June stunting the growing wheat 
And the farming sector making the painful transition from Soviet central planning to a market economy simply has no money 
Ukraine s black soil is so fertile that a diplomat described it as rich enough to grow rubber boots 
But recently Ukraine has been losing its reputation as a breadbasket of Europe earned in the years before brutal forced collectivisation under Soviet dictator Josef Stalin 
The wheat will not be of a good quality this year said Hryhory Borsuk a scientist at the Mironivka Wheat Institute run by the Ukrainian Academy of Agrarian Sciences 
The temperature on the ground reached num decrees Celsius num Fahrenheit this summer 
We ve never seen anything so bad he said in an interview in his office unlit since the government cut off electricity because of unpaid power bills 
The harvest is gathered in the dry areas but rainfall in Western Ukraine has delayed harvesting there 
While Mironivka s scientists some unpaid for months carry on developing new strains of wheat resistant to Ukraine s extreme continental climate Borsuk said the lack of cash in Ukraine s agricultural sector is as bad as the drought 
Collective farms and Ukraine s nascent private farming sector have no money for fertiliser no money for herbicides and pesticides no money to repair old or buy new machinery no money for fuel and none to buy good seed 
This year s harvest is down from last year s num million tonne harvest which in turn compares with num million tonnes in year the year before independence 
The decline is all the worse for people who recall wasteful Soviet times when the Kremlin imported grain but priced bread so cheaply that people bought it to feed their pigs 
Agriculture is very expensive and there are no solutions to our problems on the horizon said Odnosum 
He said his farm its num workers now readying the fields for winter wheat sowing expected the land to yield num tonnes per hectare num acres but ended up with num tonnes still better than the national average of num tonnes per hectare this year 
We did not have money for fertiliser we re in debt for fuel and we re borrowing diesel Odnosum said 
A few kilometres miles down the twolane road which passes Odnosum s farm where the occasional horsedrawn buggy passes by is the 1700hectare 4200acre Shevchenko collective farm built next to a village still neat and tidy despite postSoviet decay 
Chief Accountant Natalya Sypron said the collective is strapped for cash earlier this year bartering num tonnes of grain for diesel to fuel six rickety grain combines and tractors badly in need of repairs and basic maintenance 
The average family earns dashnum million karbovanets a year num num but many have not been paid in months Soprun said 
People are working out of their own dedication 
Borsuk said the farm sector has two options We can sit down and cry or we can do something 
He said the government plans to increase the sowing of the winter wheat which will be harvested next year 
Planted in late summer and early autumn the grain is Ukraine s largest export item and traditionally grows better than summer wheat in Ukraine s soil 
Further plans he said called for full provision of resources like fertiliser and herbicides for num percent of Ukraine s arable land next year for num percent in year and num percent of the land in year 
If we follow this we ll be able to sell num million tonnes of grain by the year year Borkus said 
The government has been trying to phase out huge subsidies to the farm sector and in a move back to preSoviet days has given up to num hectares num acres of land to some num private farmers willing to go it alone 
Collective farms will last for the next few years because most private farms now only produce enough to feed themselves with maybe a little extra to sell said one private farmer In the future maybe but it s better not to hurry 
Collectivisation brought us a lot of pain 
And it went too fast 
Privatising too quickly can also have a negative outcome

Gencor swells profit despite setbacks

JOHANNESBURG dashnum 
Gencor Ltd on Monday said it had swelled its year attributable profit and streamlined operations to strengthen it for the current financial year despite a variety of divisional setbacks 
Announcing the group s results for the year ended June num chairman Brian Gilbertson said Happily the strong improvement in financial performance is not an illusion arising from the recent weakness of the rand relative to the dollar 
Gencor raised attributable earnings to num million rand from num million rand previously in dollar terms an increase to num million from num million and won despite the group s Impala Platinum Holdings Ltd posting dismal results 
Not everything has gone well 
We ve had substantial production difficulties at a number of our operations 
The most obvious one with the greatest effect on the corporation was at Impala where we had the furnace failure Gilbertson said 
Implats posted year attributable profit of num million rand from num million previously 
Not only did the company lock in num rand per dollar in February March but it suffered output losses due to a furnace shutdown last August 
The rand was last bid at num against the dollar 
Nor was Implats the only operation to fail output targets 
Ingwe Coal Corporation Ltd was hit hard by heavy rains 
It forfeited nearly one million tonnes of production to flooding at its mines in Mpumulanga province 
But Gilbertson said the greatest gloom in the year came from the European Commission s blocking of Implats proposed merger with Lonrho Plc s platinum interests 
The big disappointment for the year was the failure of the platinum merger 
From Gencor s perspective we are taking the position that it is not on Gilbertson said 
Looking ahead to the current financial year he said that Gencor would boost earnings further 
Gencor is well placed to take up the challenges of the future 
The group is soundly structured and prudently financed and is blessed with an excellent portfolio of worldclass businesses 
I think we can look forward to further growth 
Citing the disposal of Gencor s stake in industrial holdings group Malbak Ltd for one billion rand among other smaller disposals Gilbertson said Gencor had pruned its portfolio to concentrate on core assets 
We ve tried to clean up our overall portfolio by disposing of noncore assets 
The biggest of those was Malbak 
Overall a very substantial pruning 
leaving Gencor clearly structured along commodity lines Gilbertson said 
He added that the group still had about num million rand after tax invested in various shares which were market for disposal when required 
Referring to Gencor s increased num percent stake in Ingwe Gilbertson said the group would wait for coal shares to be cheaper before considering snapping up more 
I think we would have liked to have more of Ingwe but it s the question of adding value 
When we bought the shares we bought 
at quite a bit lower than the price is now 
maybe if we just wait another few years for the next downturn in coal 
Finally Gilbertson said a growing proportion of Gencor s income was coming from offshore and unlisted investments

LEEDS England dashnum 
Winger Lee Sharpe hit a superb strike from the edge of the penalty area to give Leeds their first win of the season on Monday and leave hapless Wimbledon anchored at the bottom of the England premier league

MOSCOW dashnum 
Russian double Olympic swimming champion Alexander Popov was in a serious condition on Monday after being stabbed on a Moscow street

His condition is serious said Rimma Maslova deputy chief doctor of Hospital No num in the Russian capital 
But he is conscious and is talking and smiling 
Maslova told Reuters she was not an expert in sports medicine but said it was too early to judge Popov s chances of returning to competitive swimming 
Popov who won gold in the num and num metres freestyle at the recent Atlanta Olympics was stabbed in the abdomen late on Saturday after an argument with a group of roadside watermelon sellers in southwest Moscow 
Maslova said the wound had affected a lung and a kidney

Popov told NTV television on Sunday he was in no danger and promised he would be back in the pool shortly 
There s no need to worry 
We re going to be walking soon and swimming he insisted cheerfully from his bed in the intensive care unit 
Interfax news agency said police had detained one of the attackers 
It said the row started when Popov and a group of his friends were returning from a party 
Vitaly Smirnov president of the Russian National Olympic Committee said President Boris Yeltsin had given the swimmer Russia s top award for his Olympic performance 
I am not a doctor but I think he is doing all right said Smirnov 
Smirnov said the Olympic Committee might ask the government to take measures to protect the country s best athletes some of whom have already chosen to live abroad for fear of a surge in crime in postSoviet Russia

TENNIS QUENCH YOUR THIRST IF YOU CAN AFFORD IT AT US OPEN 
Bill Berkrot 
NEW YORK dashnum 
A message on television monitors all around the National Tennis Centre reads Due to hot weather please seek shade and drink plenty of fluids sound advice until you check out the price of fluids 
Perhaps the advisory was cut off before concluding and bring plenty of money 
A small bottle of a garishlycoloured sports drink at the sundrenched US Open is going for num while a litre of basic lifesustaining water will set you back num for water 
At the Olympics water was only a dollar and that was the Olympics said one incredulous fan noting that the Atlanta Games had been notorious for price gouging 
US Open officials managed to insult most of the male tennis players last week with their controversial handling of the seeding and draw 
When the tournament began on Monday it was the fans turn to be offended 
That baked lasagna better be good for num said New Yorker Rebecca Weinstein a US Open regular who was eating a sandwich she had brought from home 
A trio of hungry fans at the food court who had already forked over the lasagna money pronounced it good but Carol Perry chimed in The water is ridiculous they want four dollars for the water you might as well get a glass of wine 
Indeed a nice glass of chardonnay or white zinfandel was going for num while an imported beer was just a bit more than the water at num 
What s the message here 
Maybe they want us to be alcoholics Perry joked before lifting her glass of wine 
Fans will be shelling out num for a hamburger and a large french fries 
And that little snack is guaranteed to make you thirsty 
Make that num 
Even a sandwich as pedestrian as a ham and swiss cheese is going for a whopping num 
Of course it is served on a tuscan roll 
It must be the cost of flying those rolls over from Tuscany every day that drives up the price of the sandwich

The 15yearold Hingis seeded 16th was honoured to play the first match of the season s last Grand Slam on Stadium Court but happy to hurry off with a straightsets victory over the 112thranked Angeles Montolio of Spain 
It was very hot and I did nt want to stay long on the court said a cheery Hingis who had no worries in racing to a dashnum dashnum victory against the overmatched Spaniard 
Hoping for a longer engagement on the cement at Flushing Meadows were the sixthseeded Huber of Germany and 12th seed Maleeva of Bulgaria 
Huber who lost to Monica Seles in the Australian Open final fell victim to an unfortunate draw in bowing to dangerous floater Amanda Coetzer of South Africa 
Coetzer ranked 17th avenged her defeat to Huber in the Australian Open semifinals by winning dashnum dashnum dashnum 
I looked at it as not a first round match just a great challenge for me said Coetzer num 
I was really concentrating on keeping my own momentum and my own rhythm 
She is tough to play in that way because she plays very up and down 
She played one great game and than a few errors 
The challenge was just for me to keep playing my own game 
Huber who reached the final a week ago at Manhattan Beach could only mourn her luck of the draw 
I was nt happy when I saw the draw 
She was the first non seeded player said the 21yearold German 
It s always tough to play somebody like that in the first round in a Grand Slam 
I think I did nt play that bad today 
It was maybe my best first round match in a Grand Slam I ever played 
Monday brought the best out in US Open rookie Aleksandra Olsza of Poland ranked 110th 
The 18yearold Olsza last year s Wimbledon junior champion celebrated her debut in the main draw of the Open by removing Maleeva dashnum dashnum 
The curtainraising victories by Hingis and Olsza provided a ringing endorsement for the newest wave of women s players coming up from the junior ranks 
The Swiss teenager a twice French Open junior champion and a Wimbledon juniors winner had already proven her main stage mettle by reaching the quarters at this year s Australian Open 
I hope I can get into the last num said Hingis seeded to face third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario in the fourth round 
Hingis has been working hard on conditioning and has lost eight pounds num kilos in advance of the championships 
There will be tough matches but I hope I can get there she said 
Then we ll see if Arantxa will be there too 
The fastmoving Olsza num was cool in her opening match 
I was nt scared when I heard that I was playing Maleeva said Olsza 
I know that if I want to play professional tennis I have to do my best to try to beat her and I ca nt be scared 
Olsza is undaunted by the level of competition in the pros 
In terms of tennis I think the junior players are really good now 
In a few years it could change a lot among the top players 
Two bigserving women s players made quick work of Japanese opponents 
Brenda SchultzMcCarthy of the Netherlands the 13th seed was a dashnum dashnum winner over Japan s Nana Miyaga while Czech veteran Helena Sukova prevailed over Yone Kamio dashnum dashnum

TENNIS STICH GLAD HE STAYED AFTER OPEN VICTORY 
Richard Finn 
NEW YORK dashnum 
Michael Stich nearly pulled out of the US Open in protest over the men s seeding fiasco but the former Wimbledon champion was glad he stayed after sweating out a fourset win on Monday over qualifier Tommy Haas 
I still feel it s embarrassing what happened and I was about to pull out yesterday and say That s it said Stich one of a host of men who cried foul over seeding procedures that forced an unprecedented remaking of the men s draw last week 
But there are so many reasons to play especially spectators and the kids who come out here and want to enjoy watching tennis that I decided to stay 
In a break from tradition the Open did not seed in strict accordance with ATP rankings instead taking into account other factors that raised objections of favourtism toward US players 
One prominent player that did not stay for the Open was French Open champion Yvegeny Kafelnikov who after being dropped three spots from his ATP ranking to a seventh seeding withdrew and returned home to Russia 
Kafelnikov had pulled out of last week s tournament with a rib injury 
At a news conference attended by approximately num players on Sunday US Davis Cup player Todd Martin expressed the players outrage at the seedings 
The way the US Open has seeded here tampering with the ranking system has tarnished the image and reputation of this US Open in the players mind and we think that is damaging to our sport Martin said 
Stich said he felt the players ought to have organised an active protest 
I feel that we made it a little easy for the USTA 
They did nt really get hurt as much as I think they should have said Stich 
I feel that we should have maybe just cancelled out the Monday not show up today and start the tournament tomorrow 
But once the 27yearold Stich got on the court he focused his energies on trying to win the year s last Grand Slam 
He took a positive first step with his dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum win over compatriot Haas on a sunbaked Grandstand court 
Others advancing early on Monday included 11thseeded American Malivai Washington the Wimbledon runnerup Sweden s Magnus Gustafsson and twotime former French Open champion Sergi Bruguera of Spain who will be Stich s next opponent 
The suspicion however lingers in Stich s mind that US Open officials did tamper with the seeding process in order to benefit homegrown players 
I get the feeling that everything is done here for the American players and they forget about all the other players said Stich who lost the year Open final to Andre Agassi 
It was Agassi who was at the centre of the controversy that engulfed the tournament since the original draw was completed on Wednesday 
The flamboyant American star was bumped up two spots from his ATP ranking of eight to a seeding of six 
He Agassi should be seeded the way he is playing tennis right now said Stich about the unfairness of moving up Agassi who made early exits from the French Open and Wimbledon 
Stich not seeded here for the first time since year might have benefitted from some fiddling with the seedings himself after Kafelnikov withdrew 
Ranked 18th in the world Stich might have been slipped into that spot ahead of Spain s Felix Mantilla who is 16th but had never been played in the Open and had been left out of the seedings originally 
But Stich did nt want to play that game 
I think he deserves to be seeded as everybody else who is in the top num deserves to be seeded Stich said

OSCE delays decision on refugee voting 
Kurt Schork 
SARAJEVO dashnum 
Bosnia s election organisers will decide on Tuesday whether or not to postpone municipal elections scheduled as part of nationwide balloting an OSCE spokeswoman said on Monday 
Officials from the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE are considering the postponement following allegations of serious irregularities in the registration of Serb refugees 
International observers say the alleged irregularities could affect the outcome of voting for municipal assemblies 
Tomorrow 
the Provisional Election Commission will consider the possible postponement of municipal elections only 
the other elections will be held on September num OSCE spokeswoman Agota Kuperman told reporters in Sarajevo 
I think that it would be very difficult to select which municipal elections would have to be cancelled 
I think probably if the decision to cancell were to be taken it would probably be all municipal elections 

Kuperman added that options other than postponement were also on the table but she refused to specify what they were 
The Dayton peace agreement gave the OSCE a mandate to organise Bosnian elections 
The Provisional Election Commission is OSCE s top rulemaking body for the poll 
More than num refugees have registered to vote in num countries around the world representing about num per cent of Bosnia s total electorate 
They are due to begin voting on Wednesday August num just one day after the PEC is supposed to make its decision 
Balloting inside Bosnia is scheduled for September num when citizens are slated to elect municipal and cantonal assemblies separate MoslemCroat and Serb parliaments a national House of Representatives and a threeman Presidency 
A Sarajevo daily newspaper Dnevi Avaz which is close to Bosnia s Moslem nationalist SDA party on Monday said the OSCE would postpone the municipallevel elections until the Spring of year because of the refugee registration problems 
SDA has a representative on the Provisional Election Commission 
I do nt know what the source of the Dnevi Avaz report is but it is consistent with what I have heard from western diplomats and from inside the OSCE said an OSCE staff member in Sarajevo who asked not to be named 
The word is that Frowick has decided to postpone municipal elections but that he will wait for one more session of the PEC on Tuesday to take everyone s temperature on the issue 
Ambassador Robert Frowick an American heads the OSCE mission in Bosnia 
OSCE and independent monitors allege that Serb authorities have systematically discouraged refugees from registering to cast a ballot in the places they lived before the war 
Instead the refugees were said to have been directed by their authorities to vote from strategic towns which had Moslem majorities before the 43month Bosnian war but which are now underpopulated as a result of ethnic cleansing 
Diplomats explain the purpose of this electoral engineering is to secure Serb control over pivotal towns inside the num per cent of Bosnia known as the Serb republic consolidating through the ballot box what was initially taken in war 
The top UN refugee official in the Balkans highlighted the voter registration problem on Monday 
Results of the registration for September elections herald a dismal future for multiethnicity in BosiaHercegovina warned Soren JessenPetersen Special Envoy for the UN High Commissioner for Refugees in Former Yugoslavia 
In the runup to elections nationalistic political leaders are playing the ethnic sectarian card drumming up support within their constituencies by playing on bitter memories or fear

After truce Lebed faces tougher Chechen problem 
Alastair Macdonald 
MOSCOW dashnum 
Alexander Lebed may finally get to discuss his Chechen peace proposals with Boris Yeltsin on Tuesday after a lost weekend in the region when he was forced to abandon plans to sign a new political treaty with the separatist rebels 
It could be a sobering experience for the Kremlin security chief who just two months after being appointed by the president and two heady weeks after taking charge of the Chechen crisis had promised to wrap up the 20month war by the weekend 
Despite a mood of compromise in the region after some of the worst fighting of the war Lebed may be just finding out that concluding a longterm settlement somewhere between rebel demands for independence and Moscow s insistence that Chechnya remain part of Russia will be no easy matter 
A chainsmoking former paratroop general with a sharp line in deadpan putdowns and a soldier s knack for making life sound simple Lebed managed to arrange an ambitious ceasefire in the region last week days after the Russian army threatened to bomb its way back into the rebelheld Chechen capital Grozny 
He returned at the weekend pledging to conclude a political settlement that would make this truce work where all others have failed 
But then he apparently thought better of it 
Saying he needed to tidy up legal loose ends on the deal and also cover his back against unnamed prowar schemers in Moscow he flew back to the capital emptyhanded on Sunday 
He met Russian Prime Minister Viktor Chernomyrdin on Monday and according to the press service of Lebed s Security Council could meet Yeltsin on Tuesday 
It was not clear if the start of Yeltsin s holiday announced later would affect plans to talk 
Moscow s as yet undisclosed proposals on Chechnya s political future have meanwhile been sent back to do the rounds of various government departments 
It is not known what caused the delay in the peace plan 
Speculation mounted last week that Lebed was operating out on a limb in Chechnya as Yeltsin hardly seen since his reelection last month kept out of sight and then gave an interview criticising his envoy just as he clinched a truce 
But Chernomyrdin took pains at the weekend to insist Lebed was playing for a united team and that the proposals he took to rebel chiefofstaff Aslan Maskhadov had been agreed by Yeltsin 
If that were the case it was unclear why Lebed suddenly found it necessary to have the deal verified in Moscow 
Lebed himself said he was concerned that powerful interests in Moscow who have profited from the war and want it to go on would seize on any inadequacy in the deal to remove him 
Maskhadov warned that Lebed risked the same fate as a former Russian army commander in the region who sought a compromise and was blown up last year by so the Chechens say Russian forces 
Maskhadov may also have made new demands on Lebed forcing him to check back with the Kremlin on what he could offer 
A rebel spokesman said the two military men had come close to agreement on a facesaving formula acceptable to both sides and involving a referendum on independence at some future date 
Chernomyrdin said voters should decide Chechnya s future but stressed there was no question of the government letting the region quit the Russian Federation something Moscow fears could encourage separatist tendencies in other ethnic regions particularly in the strategic North Caucasus 
Lebed may be be finding that closing that political gap between the two sides is more difficult than just ending a war

Yugo Zastava workers protest enters 2nd week 
BELGRADE dashnum 
Thousands of workers of Serbia s Zastava arms factory entered the second week of protests on Monday over unpaid wages and the lack of a programme to revive the plant s production 
We are stubborn have strength and time to persist until our demands are met said the factory s trade union secretary Dragutin Stanojlovic 
We are united and we are waiting for the government to decide what to do with us 
Trade unions demanded payment of June and July wages and last year s holiday pay and called on government to develop a revival programme for the plant

In Kragujevac where the plant is based num to num people gathered in the central square to express their bitterness at what Stanojlovic called government indifference 
The ruling Socialist Party last week accused Serbia s opposition of stirring up social unrest and using workers already difficult social position for their own interests 
Late wages no work and the lack of a production programme are the main reasons for their protests a senior member of the local Socialist Party branch told Reuters 
But there is a significant influence of opposition parties that are collecting points ahead of coming elections

Under the law before launching the strike we have to sign an agreement with our employer for a minimal transport servicing of emergency flights Raichev said 
Raichev said a lockout with military air controllers was impossible as they did not speak English

Michael Posner 
CHICAGO dashnum 
No more mildmannered and meek Al Gore the vice president and likely heir apparent to President Bill Clinton emerged on Monday as the new Democratic attack dog leading a frontline assault on Bob Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich 
While Clinton takes a train trip to the Democratic Convention that will renominate him on Wednesday for a second term Gore is the bright star in the convention city now 
Crowds anxiously wait for his appearances thrusting out hands for him to grip as they scream num more years a wishful hope to eight years of Gore after a Clinton reelection 
Over a 15hour span from Sunday evening to Monday morning so many people jammed Gore events that the fire marshal stopped members of Congress reporters and others from entering a proIsrael rally and a meeting of the New York delegation 
In his appearances the often stiff and wooden Gore seemed transformed into a new energetic gesturing pol as he ripped into Republican presidential nominee Dole and Gingrich who has emerged as the favorite rightwing foil of Democrats 
Gore told a roaring labor rally of about num union workers that Dole and Gingrich were the virtual personifaction of evil without even mentioning that former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp is Dole s running mate 
With equal measures of ignorance and audacity this twoheaded monster of Dole and Gingrich has been launching an all out assault on decades of progress of behalf of working men and women Gore said to whoops of num more years 
They want to drive you out of politics and they ca nt he added 
They want to silence your voices in elections 
At a downtown hotel Monday the 48yearold Gore gave Wisconsin delegates a taste again of the new Gore 
I want you to ask this question 
What would Wisconsin face if the same extremist coalition the Gingrich Dole Congress also controlled the executive branch 
Gore said 
Noting the next presidential term will probably see two or three Supreme Court justice nominations he warned Their extremist agenda would come out of the Gingrich Congress into and through the Dole White House down through the Supreme Court 
He painted a scene of horrors he saw if Republicans controlled the White House and the Congress they hold now 
Our personal and religious liberties would be at risk 
Medicare would be at risk of withering on the vine 
Medicaid would be at risk of being taken away from poor children 
Education would be at risk 
The environment would be at risk from the polluters that control that coalition he said 
His new style mixed an assault on Republicans with what he sees as productive opportunity a vision for the future that lifts up working families that builds Wisconsin stronger that builds America stronger 
With your help we can reelect Bill Clinton 
Dole s tax cut plans were called dejavoodoo economics It s a warmedover plan that failed and drove our economy into a ditch 
We got burned once and we wo nt let that happen to our nation again 
Gore ridiculed Dole s defense of the tobacco industry praised Clinton for courage in advancing regulations of it 
To the delegates of Wisconsin a leading dairy state Gore had the right audience in poking fun at Dole s comparison to addiction to tobacco to those who ca nt tolerate milk 
Some people say milk is bad for you Gore said as Wisconsin delegates held aloft a plastic inflated cow 
He praised Clinton for vetoing the Republican Congress attempt to repeal parts of the Clean Air Act and criticized Republicans for slashing money to combat drugs in schools 
The choice has never been starker the stakes today have never been higher Gore said 
We re not going to let them get away with that

Actor Reeve highlights Democrats first night 
CHICAGO dashnum 
The highlights of the first day of the Democratic convention on Monday were expected to feature a mix of party leaders and people who have overcome adversity 
Among the latter were gun control advocate Sarah Brady and actor Christopher Reeve and the politicians included Rep 
Richard Gephardt and Sen 
Thomas Daschle 
Here are thumbnail profiles of the convention s key Monday speakers 
Sarah Brady The nation s toughest gun control law is named after Ronald Reagan s press secretary James Brady but it was his wife who was the major force behind its passage 
As head of Handgun Control Inc Sarah Brady num campaigned nonstop for tough gun control in the years following the shooting of her husband and then President Reagan in year 
Her reward was the passage in year of the Brady Bill which requires a mandatory fiveday waiting period for purchase of handguns and also mandates background checks for wouldbe gun purchasers 
Reagan recovered fully from his wounds but Brady who was close to death after being shot by John Hinckley Jr 
suffered serious brain damage 
Sarah was Brady s second wife and they have a son James Scott Brady Jr 
Before the assassination attempt she had worked for Republican congressmen and for the Republican Party 
Christopher Reeve Reeve was best known for playing the comic book hero Superman in four movies but his greatest heroics came in real life 
Reeve an accomplished rider who owned several horses suffered multiple injuries including two shattered neck vertebrae when he was thrown from his horse at an equestrian event in Culpepper Virginia on May num year 
Almost entirely paralyzed Reeve underwent extensive surgery to fuse the vertebrae to the base of the skull and prevent any further damage to his spine 
That allowed him to be moved to a semiupright position 
Over time he regained the power of speech so much so that he was asked to address the opening night of the Democratic National Convention 
Reeve num was classically trained as an actor but became the prototypical handsome leading man 
He performed in summer stock and soap operas before being plucked as an almost unknown to play the lead in Superman and three sequels 
Richard Gephardt Gephardt House Democratic leader is a politician with a Mr Clean reputation who sought the presidency eight years ago and is widely believed to still have ambitions for the job 
Gephardt num the son of a milkman from a working class district of St Louis is a consummate congressional insider sufficiently skilled in compromise and the ways of the legislature to manage the oftenunruly House Democrats 
A former lawyer he was in the front line of President Bill Clinton s battle with the Republicanled Congress over the budget but has opposed the president s decision to sign the Republicanwritten welfare reform bill 
He advocated tough action against foreign countries to cut US trade deficits but sometimes been out of step with the party s liberal wing 
He was an opponent of abortion until year and voted for President Ronald Reagan s big tax cut bill 
Gephardt a redhaired squarejawed man is a less than fiery orator 
His year bid for the Democratic nomination only took off after he recreated himself as a firebreathing reformer of the establishment standing up for blue collar workers and farmers 
Tom Daschle Daschle num was largely unknown outside Washington and his state of South Dakota when he surprisingly beat more prominent rivals to become Senate Democratic leader after the party lost its majority to the Republicans in year 
A mildmannered and youthful man who rose rapidly after entering the Senate in year he presented himself as a Midwest moderate as a Democratic winner in a Republican state able to unite Senate factions 
Concern that he might be steamrollered by the vastly more experienced Republican leader Bob Dole was dispelled when he showed a tough edge outmaneuvering Dole in a wrangle over scrapping a gas tax and raising the federal minimum wage 
In his early Senate years he was seen as a prairie populist working on legislation protecting farmers prices and also on compensating veterans sickened by Agent Orange defoliant spraying in the Vietnam War 
Daschle was a key player in President Bill Clinton s failed attempt at sweeping healthcare changes but when he became minority leader he declared he would be no watercarrier for the White House 
He has made clear he opposed Clinton s signing of the Republicaninitiated welfare reform bill 
He has spent his adult life in politics coming to Congress as an aide in year after three years in the Air Force and then being elected to the House of Representatives himself in year

Tapie to quit French assembly seat as film opens 
PARIS dashnum 
Former businessman and soccer boss Bernard Tapie said that he would give up his seat in the National Assembly by Wednesday the day a film by Claude Lelouche in which he stars opens in France 
I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens he said in a broadcast interview 
Just about he told Europe num radio when asked whether he had sent his letter of resignation to Assembly speaker Philippe Seguin 
A Seguin spokeswoman confirmed that no letter or call had yet been received 
Tapie num was resigning just ahead of expected government action to eject him from the Assembly following a finding by the Supreme Court that he was bankrupt and thus ineligible for public office for a fiveyear period 
Tapie the target of a blizzard of legal actions over his nowdestroyed business empire and the Marseille soccer team he once ran has a starring role in Lelouche s Homme femmes mode demploi Men women instructions for use 
He plays a powerhungry lawyer in the movie described as a tender and cruel comedy by Lelouche who is making his 35th film 
I have paid too dearly for mixing two careers Tapie said 
In France you cannot be a film artist and a national politician at the same time 
That is why I will no longer be deputy by the time the film opens 
Justice Minister Jacques Toubon began last month the formal process of ejecting Tapie from the French parliament as well as stripping him of his seat in the European parliament 
The French procedure was expected to be completed before October num when the National Assembly is to reconvene after a summer break but the European procedure was expected to take longer 
Tapie s lawyer has said he intends to appeal to the European Court of Human Rights in an effort to prevent or delay the loss of his European seat 
But such an appeal even if the court were to accept the case which it is not obliged to do would not suspend enforcement of the French judgement against him 
Tapie faces a probable spell in prison after he loses his parliamentary immunity since two appeal courts have confirmed jail sentences of eight and six months against him for tax fraud and rigging a soccer match 
He is appealing in both cases to the Supreme Court

The unlisted bank earlier announced a year interim net profit of num million guilders up num percent on the num million guilders reported in the first half of year

FOCUS Eurobourses end mixed but London recovers 
Leonard Santorelli 
LONDON dashnum 
European bourses closed mixed on Tuesday with London clawing back most of the day s losses despite an unsteady start on wall Street hit by inflation worries 
The dollar weakened during the day with many dealers sidelined because of uncertainty over Tokyo s monetary direction ahead of the important Japanese Tankan economic survey out on Wednesday 
But it recovered at the close of trade 
Stocks in London started the week badly after a threeday weekend slipping num percent but bargainhunters later moved in and the FTSE index recovered most of the lost ground to end only just in negative ground 
Tuesday s patchy showing in London followed a string of records last week culminating in Friday s trading high of num fuelled by a wave of European interest rate cuts 
The London bourse drew little help from the unsettled morning on Wall Street which slipped in and out of positive ground after a strongerthanexpected August consumer confidence report refuelled inflation fears pulling US Treasuries back from their early peaks 
Shortly after the report appeared showing the confidence index rising to num in August from a revised num in July Wall Street relinquished virtually all its morning gains 
Treasuries remain very sensitive to any indication of a strong economy and we re still in that summer doldrum period of light trading said Alan Ackerman market strategist at Fahnestock Co 
Consequently stocks and bonds are both subject to rapid swings 
Frankfurt was the one bright spot in Europe 
Floor trading ended up num percent and the computerised IBIS index climbed nearly num percent given a push by the performance of chemical shares 
The market is trading num percent on fundamentals at the moment as interest rate fantasy disappears it s all company news said one trader 
French shares ended slightly down amid growing unease about a difficult autumn for the government which also weighed on the franc dealers said 
Bond prices were weaker and the franc was quoted at num per mark for the first time since August num as worries about the government s autumn budget and a weak US currency lifted the mark and squeezed French investments 
The dollar which dropped sharply on Monday because of jitters over the Japanese Tankan survey weakened further in quiet trading but regained losses to end the day close to Monday s levels 
Besides the Tankan there s nothing really until the US jobs numbers next week said a UK bank corporate dealer 
There is still the summer malaise hanging over the market 
Foreign exchange markets regard the Tankan report as an important indication of the country s future monetary policy direction 
If it points to weakness in the economy the report will help the dollar regain some lost ground as speculation of a nearterm rise in Japanese interest rates will evaporate 
The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of num percent

FEATURE Eco terrorists target UK builders 
Edna Fernandes 
LONDON dashnum 
Ecological warfare has broken out across the British construction industry striking some of the biggest corporates as activists give up peaceful protests and seek to hit builders where it hurts their profit margins 
Described by one British company as ecoterrorism it is seen as the new business risk of the 1990s 
Famous names like Tarmac Plc Costain Group Plc and ARC a unit of conglomerate Hanson Plc have all been targeted 
Activist groups are no longer seen by British firms as a harmless badly organised ragbag of students and hippies 
You only have to see them in action at protests said David Harding spokesman at ARC Hanson s aggregates company 
They walk around with mobile phones and camera equipment they communicate and gather support for demos via the Internet we re talking about a highly sophisticated organisation 
One road protestor under the codename Steady Eddie told construction journal Building earlier this year If it comes down to fullscale economic warfare we will aim to drive them out of business 
As well as financial threats companies also emphasise the terror tactics used 
Costain s contract to build the controversial Newbury bypass which runs through a conservation area has led to violent protests delaying building bomb threats staff intimidation and picketing of chief executive Alan Lovell s home 
A Costain spokesman told Reuters We ve had all sorts of protests at the head office and the chief executive s house 
But it s when it gets to the employee families that it goes across the line 
Tactics used by some underground groups including the cryptic Berkshire Wood Elves which distribute leaflets with instructions on homemade explosives are now the subject of a police investigation 
Other larger activist groups include Earth First The Land is Ours Alarm UK and Road Alert 
The groups have targeted specific projects like the Newbury bypass and the M3 motorway through Twyford Down in the southern county of Hampshire 
But they are also campaigning on broader issue such as stopping the government road building programme and outoftown superstores which they say create more traffic pollution and damage local communities 
The government has slashed its roadbuilding spending 
Although protests may have contributed to the decision it has been seen primarily as economic rather than ecological 
Graham Watts chief executive of the Construction Industry Council said I do nt think many firms involved in tendering for sensitive projects realise the impact environmental activity has on the cost of running a project 
But they are more alert than they were dashnum years ago 
There s no doubt it s a big issue now 
He says the damage comes in two forms Tangible in the form of extra costs additional security threats to staff and the more intangible damage caused by negative publicity 
Watts said the cost of protesting can be heavy once the company is locked into a contract 
I do often hear on the industry circuit of tales where the company tenders at low margins and the demonstrations which follow means they are running the project at a loss 
ARC says it s not just contractors in the front line but also suppliers like itself 
Its own quarries came under attack after it emerged that it may be a supplier for the Newbury bypass 
It was called the First Battle of the Newbury bypass said ARC s Harding 
We had num Earth First protestors invade and occupy our site 
Hundreds of thousands of pounds dollars of damage was done in one day 
Plus there was the knockon cost of lost production and extra security in future 
Simon Brown analyst at investement bank UBS said this new phenomenon has led to a change in the way the industry evaluates project risk 
When talking to Tarmac about the M3 link through Twyford Down they made it fairly clear that their risk assessment methods have been changed and now involve a very clear environmental risk analysis 
Harding says others have done the same 
As a result of ecoterrorism we are looking at controversial jobs more closely to see if the profit margins are wide enough to cover things like extra security 
For an industry already suffering from razorthin margins overcapacity and stagnant demand ecoterrorism is the latest bizarre twist in the construction sector s tale of woe

Larry Fine 
NEW YORK dashnum 
Michael Chang is playing in his 10th US Open and enjoying his highest seeding ever but the 24yearold American had to overcome a case of the jitters Monday before winning his firstround match on opening day 
Chang seeded second behind defending champion Pete Sampras took two hours num minutes to defeat 186thranked Jaime Oncins of Brazil dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum in the tiebreaker 
I was pretty tight the whole match conceded Chang one of the hottest players on tour this summer with a dashnum record on hardcourts that included two titles and a runnerup finish 
Everyone has moments when they get tight 
Hopefully this will have been my nerves for the whole tournament 
Joining Chang into the second round was Wimbledon runnerup MaliVai Washington the 11th seed who also needed four sets to get past talented Moroccan Karim Alami dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum 
Washington s win was not comfortable either 
The 27yearold American hurried off the Stadium Court for treatment of an upset stomach after his two and a half hour struggle against Alami 
Towards the end of my match my stomach felt like weekold sushi said Washington 
Maybe it was a combination of the heat and something I ate 
Chang and Washington were the only men s seeds in action on a day that saw two seeded women s players fall 
Australian Open runnerup Anke Huber of Germany the sixth seed was undone by an unlucky draw that put her against 17th ranked South African Amanda Coetzer in her opening match 
Coetzer claimed revenge for the semifinal defeat she suffered to Huber in Melbourne by taking a dashnum dashnum dashnum victory 
Last year s Wimbledon junior champion Aleksandra Olsza of Poland removed another seed from the draw by eliminating number num Magdalena Maleeva of Bulgaria dashnum dashnum 
Other men s winners included a pair of former Grand Slam tournament champions whose victories set up a showdown in the second round

Tarango was leading dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum 
Chang blamed breezy conditions for some of the erratic play in his match with Oncins who had beaten him in the round of num at the year Barcelona Olympics 
Chang committed an untidy num unforced errors though he made seven fewer than the Brazilian who also walloped a woeful num double faults 
The most deflating double fault came when Oncins was serving to force a fifth set leading dashnum in the tiebreaker 
The set point came after confusion at the net on the point previous which was awarded to Oncins after the two exchanged shots at close quarters at the net 
First Chang approached the umpire then Oncins then Chang again before play finally resumed 
Those little seconds were like an hour to me said Oncins who promptly fired two serves barely contained by the baseline as he frittered away his best chance 
Chang ran off the next three points to close out the match but for Oncins the contest was a personal victory 
The 26yearold Brazilian had risen into the top num in year 
The next year a close friend was struck by a stray bullet while riding home in a car from a soccer game in Sao Paulo 
He died slumped against Oncins who subsequently lost interest in tennis 
Two months ago I started talking about quitting said Oncins who decided to give it one last try and made it through the Open qualifying tournament last weekend 
I believe in my game again he said 
At the end of the day a spate of withdrawals from the tournament were announced 
Eighth seed Jim Courier withdrew because of a bruised right knee and year Open champion Mats Wilander bowed out due to a groin pull organisers said 
Women s ninth seed Mary Joe Fernandez pulled out because of tendinitis in her right wrist

SOCCER MARSEILLE HOLD AUXERRE TO GOALLESS DRAW 
PARIS dashnum 
Former European champions Marseille held French champions Auxerre to a goalless draw in a lacklustre league match on Tuesday 
The bill looked promising but both sides struggling to find their form early in the season were disappointing 
Auxerre who start their European Cup campaign next week against Ajax Amsterdam dominated the match but were unable to score 
Unbeaten in four matches they still trail leaders Lens by one point 
Lens who have won all their three league matches so far host Montpellier on Wednesday night 
Despite another dismal performance especially in defence Marseille restored some pride by keeping the reigning champions at bay after losing dashnum at home to Metz last Saturday 
After two seasons in the second division and after taking on half a dozen new recruits this season some of whom do not speak a word of French Marseille are not playing with any fluidity 
But German international goalkeeper Andreas Koepke again proved a sound investment when under pressure from the Auxerre strikers saving his team with a number of fine parries 
Marseille now lie seventh in the league on five points

COFINEC SLIPS ON BUDAPEST BOURSE BUT FUTURE STRONG 
Emese Bartha 
BUDAPEST dashnum 
Expectations that Cofinec SA the Hungarian bourse s first foreign listing will report a disappointing first half have depressed the stock below its issue price but analysts expect a rebound in the long term 
The first half of the year is unlikely to be as strong as expected so the company will probably be unable to reach its annual plan in year said Gabor Sitanyi a Londonbased analyst for ING Barings 
The Frenchregistered packaging materials company which floated its shares in Hungary in July for most of the past two weeks hovered below the num forints Global Depositary Receipts price of its initial offering which was oversubscribed 
The company which asked for a twoweek delay from the usual August num deadline for reporting firsthalf results closed on Tuesday at num forints down num 
Cofinec s firsthalf figures will be 
between onethird of twofifths of its annual plan said Tamas Erdei a Budapestbased analyst for ABNAMRO Hoare Govett 
Analysts blame at least partly Hungary s macroeconomic environment for the weaker figures for Cofinec which operating in Hungary Poland and the Czech Republic now generates about num to num percent of its annual sales from Hungary 
Hungary s Gross Domestic Product fell one percentage point in the first quarter while real wages plunged num percentage points in the first half of year 
Both will have their impact on Cofinec s figures the analysts said 
Despite the current difficulties however analysts were convinced that Cofinec s outlook was strong 
The eastern European market offers good chances said Erdei 
Just like many other companies on the bourse Cofinec has big growth opportunities 
At the same time it s an advantage for Cofinec that it has a foreign management which perhaps understands the market better Erdei added 
Cofinec is a very good story in the longterm as the per capita packaging consumption is still so low in east Europe that a very strong increase can be expected longterm Sitanyi said saying that several recent moves by Cofinec boosted its position 
Among them he noted that Cofinec had acquired the outstanding stake in its Czech folding company Krpaco as increasing its ownership to num percent so in the second half the whole of Krpaco s figures will be consolidated 
The company also repaid some num million of debt well above the originally planned num million to num million 
In addition its Polish operation began with some six weeks of delay due to cold winter weather and the test run was also longer than planned

Sudanese rebels say missionaries should be freed 
Peter Smerdon 
NAIROBI dashnum 
The main rebel group in south Sudan said on Tuesday it was trying to arrange the release of six Roman Catholic missionaries including three Australian nuns held for nearly two weeks 
George Garang Nairobi spokesman for the Sudan People s Liberation Army SPLA said it was urgently trying to contact SPLA commander Nuour Marial at Mapourdit in the south to free the six 
The movement is making arrangements for them to be set free 
This is a decision of the leadership Garang said 
Commander Nuour Marial is a soldier so he must accept the leadership s decision 
But communications at this time of year are very difficult because of rains and a lack of power he added 
The Catholic Information Office in Nairobi said on Monday that four of the six had been charged by the SPLA with spying spreading Islam and hindering recruitment into the rebel group 
These charges are the interpretation of the church Garang said on Tuesday 
We have no idea why they are being held 
We are still trying to establish contact with the local commander 
Asked whether this meant the commander was out of control Garang said the rebel movement was working on the problem 
He said he believed all six were being held in the mission compound at Mapourdit and were reported to be in good health 
The Catholic Information office in Nairobi said on Monday that Australian Sisters Moira Lynch num and Mary Batchelor num American Father Michael Barton num and Sudanese Father Raphael Riel num were held in a prison in south Sudan by the SPLA 
It said Australian Sister Maureen Carey num and Italian Brother Raniero Iacomella num were held inside the compound 
The church in Australia said on Monday Lynch Batchelor Barton and Riel were held in a prison until the weekend when they were moved to join the other captives at the compound 
The Catholic Information Office said the SPLA in the Kenyan capital had attributed the detentions of the six to a local commander and had promised they would be freed by August num 
But the church learned in a recent meeting with the local commander that no instructions to release the prisoners were received and they would be held until investigations were completed 
It said last Friday they were visited by Monsignor Caesar Mazzolari apostolic administrator of the diocese of Rumbek in southern Sudan and an SPLA administrator and appeared in good condition 
On August num the mission was surrounded by the SPLA and sealed off 
The evening of the same day the missionaries were put in prison or isolation 
Later the mission was looted it added 
An Australian foreign ministry official said the charges against them were fairly bizarre and a matter for concern 
He said Australian diplomats in Nairobi were working with the Roman Catholic church in southern Sudan and with US and Italian diplomats in the region to help free the missionaries 
The SPLA has fought Khartoum s government forces in the south since year for greater autonomy or independence of the mainly Christian and animist region from the Moslem Arabised north

OSCE postpones Bosnian municipal elections 
SARAJEVO dashnum 
The US diplomat in charge of elections in Bosnia announced on Tuesday that voting for municipal assemblies would be postponed because of irregularities by the Serbs in registering voters 
Ambassador Robert Frowick representing the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE told reporters that municipal polls due on September num with other Bosnian elections would be put off 
I have made a chairman s decision that it is not feasible to hold municipal elections on September num said Frowick 
He said no exact date had been set but it was possible the local elections would take place in the spring of year 
According to OSCE officials Serb authorities have pressed their refugees to register to vote in towns now under Serb control but which used to have Moslem majorities 
Human rights workers say authorities in Serbia and Bosnian Serb territory have conducted a wellorganised campaign to coerce refugees into registering only on Serb territory and failed to inform them of their rights under the Dayton peace agreement 
Diplomats say the effect of the electoral engineering would be to establish political control over districts they conquered and ethnically cleansed in war 
The response of the Bosnian Serbs to the OSCE s announcement was not immediately clear 
But Bosnian Serb leaders have hinted they would boycott the poll if the municipal elections were postponed or go ahead with their own 
The Bosnian Serb cabinet in a letter to the OSCE said on Monday that any delay of local elections would be a direct and flagrant violation fo the Dayton agreement 
The Serbs who administer half of Bosnia in a Serb republic said they had met all conditions for holding the September elections 
Diplomats fear that the crisis could cast doubt over the entire election process which already appears set to confirm Bosnia s ethnic partition rather than its reintegration as the Dayton peace agreement had planned

New talks in Chechnya as Lebed waits for Yeltsin 
Dmitry Kuznets 
NOVYE ATAGI Russia dashnum 
Russian and rebel military commanders finally met in Chechnya on Tuesday for delayed talks aimed at finalising a ceasefire arranged last week by President Boris Yeltsin s envoy Alexander Lebed 
The Russian army commander in the region General Vyacheslav Tikhomirov arrived at the rebelheld village of Novye Atagi some num km num miles south of the Chechen capital Grozny for discussions with rebel chiefofstaff Aslan Maskhadov 
But Lebed himself the Kremlin security chief is still waiting back in Moscow to meet Yeltsin over his plans for a lasting political settlement in Chechnya 
ItarTass news agency quoted the Kremlin press service as saying Yeltsin who left for a state holiday home near Moscow on Monday would hold no working meetings on Tuesday 
Lebed interrupted talks with Chechnya s separatists on a political deal on Sunday saying he had to consult with Yeltsin 
After a meeting failed to materialise on Monday Lebed s spokesman said he might meet the president on Tuesday 
But Yeltsin s spokesman rebuffed the suggestion saying the president had left Moscow for a holiday near the capital 
The Russians postponed the talks after a Chechen band disarmed a column of interior ministry troops on Sunday 
The Chechens said a renegade group seized the weapons and said on Monday they had all been returned 
The Russian command insisted that not all the weapons were the same as those taken 
Tass said the weapons and the practical implementation of the ceasefire signed by Lebed and Maskhadov last Thursday would be on the agenda of today s talks 
Neither spoke to reporters before the meeting which started around num am num GMT 
Also in Novye Atagi on Tuesday morning was Tim Guldimann the Swiss diplomat who heads the Chechnya mission of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE 
Guldimann who helped broker an earlier truce in May was not taking part in the TikhomirovMaskhadov talks 
Lebed s peace mission this month has stopped some of the worst fighting of the 20monthold conflict 
However tension on the ground indicates that it could falter if the momentum for a settlement is not maintained 
Three Russian servicemen were wounded in a total of six shooting incidents overnight ItarTass news agency quoted the Russian military as saying on Tuesday morning 
RIA news agency quoted an army source accusing rebel fighters of failing to turn up for joint RussianChechen police patrols in some districts of the capital Grozny on Tuesday 
But the separatist command told Interfax news agency the patrols part of the truce brokered by Lebed last week would begin on Tuesday after delays for technical reasons 
Yeltsin s spokesman said he might meet officials during his break but indicated Lebed was low on the list by saying Yeltsin would need time to study the proposals before talking to him 
Russian news agencies also quoted the Kremlin spokesman as saying that Lebed s representatives had not sought a meeting hinting at an attempt by the president to put his popular and outspoken protege in his place with a lesson on protocol 
Yeltsin num has kept a low profile since he was reelected in July prompting new speculation that the two heart attacks he suffered last year and a rumoured drinking problem could be taking their toll weakening his grip on affairs of state 
Aides have dismissed such speculation insisting that he simply needs a rest after his energetic election campaign 
Some analysts say the Kremlin leader whose order sending troops and tanks into Chechnya in year started Russia s illfated military campaign could merely be reluctant to put his name to a peace process which might fall apart 
But Lebed who has no real power without his boss and has hinted at dark forces in Moscow working against him appears to think a deal will not stick without strong backing from Yeltsin 
His proposals have not been spelled out but are expected to involve a compromise between the separatists demand for independence and Moscow s insistence that Chechnya remain part of the Russian Federation

Junior Nationalist members of Romania s ruling coalition called on Tuesday for the impeachment of President Ion Iliescu for backing a friendship treaty with neighbouring Hungary 
Iliescu s Party of Social Democracy the senior coalition partner immediately dismissed the National Unity Party PUNR demand as crude electioneering 
It is a desperate move by the PUNR which is losing its only reason for existing ahead of the electoral campaign said PDSR executive president Adrian Nastase 
This treaty is both necessary and good Nastase said adding that the PUNR s stance was threatening its position in the government 
The treaty agreed unexpectedly two weeks ago will end years of disputes over the status of Romania s large ethnic Hungarian minority 
It will also boost both countries chances of admission to NATO and the European Union 
If they the PUNR are so vexed they could leave the government 
We might also help them to do it if they go on like this he said

PUNR leader Gheorghe Funar said in a statement Iliescu in power since the fall of communism in year should be impeached for treason for compromising on the issue of ethnic Hungarian minority rights in the treaty due to be signed next month 
Funar s call came on the eve of the official launch of Iliescu s campaign for a new term at November num polls 
His appeal to the opposition to back his attempt to oust Iliescu was unlikely to succeed analysts said

UN and diplomatic sources said on Tuesday that Secretary General Boutros BoutrosGhali had appointed Italian Gualtiero Fulcheri and sent him to Iraq last week to replace Moroccan Mohamed Zejjari 
One diplomat said Iraq and UN were still in disagreement on how many international observers would be required to ascertain the equitable distribution of humanitarian supplies that will be procured under Baghdad s oil deal with UN 
The United Nations would like to employ hundreds of foreign monitors 
Baghdad says it can only accept a few dozens said the diplomat

Observation of food supplies and their distribution are still a major issue and seems the two sides have not yet filled the gap separating them said another diplomat

Antiabortion speaker praises Democrat tolerance 
Alan Elsner 
CHICAGO dashnum 
An antiabortion politician addressed the Democratic convention on Tuesday but praised the overwhelmingly proabortion rights party for its tolerance of his minority views 
Rep 
Tony Hall of Ohio said he and other Democrats who opposed abortion had always felt left out in their own party 
But this year is different 
For the first time the Democratic Party has included in our platform a conscience clause he said 
The clause recognizes and welcomes Democrats with divergent views on abortion and states they have a full part to play at all levels of the party 
The Democratic Party is indeed the party of true inclusiveness Hall said 
At its convention four years ago organizers prevented then Pennsylvania Gov 
Robert Casey a vehement opponent of abortion from speaking 
Republicans have used their decision as an example of Democrat intolerance ever since 
Casey told a news conference in Chicago on Tuesday he had asked to speak again this year but was turned down 
Democratic leaders said there was not room on the program for every retired governor to speak 
I believe the Democratic party ought to be prowoman prochild and prolife Casey said 
I asked for the opportunity to deliver this message from the podium of the Democrat National Convention 
For the second time in four years my request fell on deaf ears he said 
The Republican Party whose platform calls for making all abortions illegal faced a similar dilemma this year when Massachusetts Gov 
William Weld asked to deliver a speech defending abortion rights and was turned down 
Bob Dole the Republican presidential nominee tried and failed to insert a tolerance clause in his party s platform recognizing the validity of those within the party who supported abortion rights 
Democrats also heard Tuesday two passionate speeches defending abortion rights 
Kate Michelman president of the National Abortion Rights Action League described how she had an abortion at a time when the procedure was illegal after her husband abandoned her with three young children 
I m here to speak up for choice and to speak for truth 
The message from the Republican Party is one of disdain 
Their answer to choice is control and punishment 
Our answer is trust compassion and respect she said

I d already had three local breeders have a look at them and sent photos and videos of the birds to the eastern states for authentication they said they re nice birds Drew told reporters outside court

If not for the informant the painted parrots true colours would not have been known for six months he said 
They moult in the summer so five or six months down the track I would have looked like the guilty party Drew said

Nuclear pact will be a step to disarmamentChina 
BEIJING dashnum 
China on Tuesday reaffirmed its support for a global nuclear test ban treaty blocked by India last week saying the pact would be an important step in achieving total nuclear disarmament 
Although the final draft of the treaty probably did nt totally satisfy any country it was in general balanced the official People s Daily newspaper said in a commentary 
India blocked the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty CTBT at the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva saying the pact did not contain a clause committing the five declared nuclear powers to a timetable for nuclear disarmament 
New Delhi s stance which was seen as effectively thwarting 212 years of negotiations at the Conference on Disarmament drew widespread but generally muted foreign criticism 
India has also pledged to oppose any forwarding of the draft treaty to the United Nations General Assembly 
China said many countries had compromised to complete the treaty and that the issue of a disarmament schedule could be discussed in future negotiations 
The completion of the test ban treaty would be an important and practical step in the gradual process of achieving total nuclear disarmament it said 
China has pledged support for the pact since reaching a deal with the United States that made international inspections of nuclear sites more difficult than in earlier drafts of the accord 
The newspaper said China advocated the complete ban and destruction of nuclear weapons but that there was little hope other nuclear powers would soon adopt the same stance 
Some nuclear powers stubbornly uphold policies of nuclear deterrence based on first use of nuclear weapons it said 
China held on July num what it said would be its last nuclear test before a selfimposed moratorium that took effect the following day 
China was the last declared nuclear power to announce a halt to testing

Sakai near the regional commercial centre of Osaka has been hit hardest by the deadly bacteria with nearly num mostly schoolchildren affected by the disease 
Two children in Sakai have died from complications associated with the bacteria

There are still patients hospitalised and problems which must be dealt with a city spokesman said citing the issue of whether to allow children infected with the bacteria but not showing symptoms to attend school from September 
Health authorities believe school lunches were the source of the food poisoning in Sakai but researchers have been unable to pinpoint the exact source of the infection 
The outbreak has prompted authorities to tighten sanitary standards at slaughterhouses and meatpacking plants and sparked calls for an overhaul of the nation s school lunch programme 
The ministers agreed at Tuesday s cabinet meeting to step up inspection measures for school lunches in September and October when schools around the country resume 
Japan s Agriculture Ministry also announced that it will compile hygiene guidelines based on US government methods of checking the safety of farm produce to prevent another outbreak of the epidemic

SEC adopts rules to improve investor access to best stock prices 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
The Securities and Exchange Commission Wednesday approved rules designed to give stock market investors a better chance at getting the best price available for their orders 
The socalled order handling rules which were proposed last September were approved in a dashnum vote 
The new rules will require specialists at stock exchanges and market makers on Nasdaq to allow customers to view price quotes from other electronic trading systems that may not be readily available to them 
The rules will also require that customer limit orders be displayed with prices better than those available in quotes publicly available at the time 
Specialists and market makers are companies or individuals recognised as qualified to maintain an orderly market in a stock 
In a limit order investors specify the price at which they are willing to buy or sell as opposed to a market order executed at prevailing prices 
These rules are intended to empower all investors by allowing their orders to compete on a level playing field and by providing the disclosure they need to make informed decisions said SEC Chairman Arthur Levitt 
The SEC s goal he added was to create one system where one price could be available to everybody 
The director of the SEC s division of market regulation Richard Lindsey said Wall Street firms will probably need to spend about num million to carry out the improvements called for by the new rules 
In proposing the rules last year the SEC noted that while technology has improved commonplace practices still existed that worked against investors best interests 
It noted that customers whose orders were not displayed lost the chance of getting the best possible price available in the market 
It also cited the potential problem of a twotiered market in which market makers quote one price to public investors while quoting better prices in private systems thus robbing investors without access to hidden quotes the benefit of the best available prices 
Earlier this month the SEC settled charges of alleged malpractices on Nasdaq when the parent of the Nasdaq market the National Association of Securities Dealers agreed to spend num million over five years to upgrade its oversight of brokers trading practices 
The SEC dropped a third proposal that would have allowed investors with market orders to trade at a better price if there were shifts in prices before their orders were executed 
The agency said it would monitor effects of the two new rules before considering the price improvement proposal again 
The agency also proposed rule changes that would require continuous bid and ask quotations from exchange specialists and market makers who trade more than num percent of a stock during any quarter on Nasdaq 
The SEC s limit order display rule will mean a major change for Nasdaq where such orders have never been displayed 
The president of the Nasdaq Alfred Berkeley was to hold a news conference Wednesday afternoon to elaborate on the new rules effects on the market the second largest in the world

Saskatchewan Wheat Pool eyes hog market 
WINNIPEG dashnum 
Canada s largest grain handling firm said Wednesday it expects to forge a partnership with hog farmers by year with a view to expanding the company s scope into pork production 
Saskatchewan is well positioned to take advantage of growing world markets for pork Saskatchewan Wheat Pool chief executive Don Loewen said in a company statement 
SWP said it was analyzing potential partnerships with hog farmers and expected the first deal to be in place in year 
The end of Canada s rail freight subsidy last year caused a shift in feed grain production to the eastern Prairie 
Analysts said livestock production would likely shift to the eastern Prairie rather than feed grains being shipped to the western Prairie 
SWP said it may develop pork production systems that provide farmers with large integrated units and it may consider contracting programs between producers and packers which would operate within the existing hog market framework 
Saskatchewan Pork International Marketing Group has an export monopoly but some Saskatchewan farmers earlier this month called for an open market in hogs

TENNIS SERIOUS MEDVEDEV IS HAVING FUN AGAIN 
Richard Finn 
NEW YORK dashnum 
Outspoken Andrei Medvedev exchanged his reputation as the clown prince of tennis on Wednesday for a new nononsense attitude that has made life on the courts fun again 
I think I m much more focused on what I have to do and that s playing tennis Medvedev said after routing Frenchman JeanPhilippe Fleurian dashnum dashnum dashnum in the opening round of the US Open 
It was Medvedev s sixth victory in a row after winning his first tournament of the year last week at the Hamlet Cup 
I realised this year that without putting num percent of your mind into tennis I do nt think you can successful said the 22yearold Medvedev 
The whole day I m thinking abnout tennis 
I felt that all the other things I was doing the years before they were distracting me they were not helping me at all 
For Medvedev that meant confining his postmatch comments to tennis and not going off on tirades about about peripheral issues such as the poor quality of food in the players lounge an entertaining rant that took his mind off the task at hand 
I know what I m here for said Medvedev who lost in the second round of the Open the last two years after reaching the quarters in year the same year he tried his hand as a restaurant critic 
I m not here to fight the press or talk about the food or entertain the people off the court 
I m here to play tennis and to win 
I have much less fun off the court 
I have much more fun on the court he said 
Just three years ago Medvedev was one of the world s best with a ranking of six after reaching the French Open semifinal and winning three tournaments 
But Medvedev s ranking slowly began to drop last year as he struggled with a wrist injury 
The Ukrainian finally hit a low of 44th two months ago 
It s somewhere where I would nt like to stay very long Medvedev said of his current ranking of num 
It s a part of the penalty that I have to accept 
As part of his new businesslike approach Medvedev hired Australian coach Bob Brett at the start of this year and the partnership is beginning to pay off 
At the beginning of the year we started from zero said Medvedev 
Winning in Long Island last week was like winning for the first time 
While Medvedev s 77minute romp past Fleurian was rather ordinary the fact that the two were playing each other was rather remarkable 
In the original draw Medvedev and Fleurian were slotted to play each other 
When controversy forced the draw to be done over against odds of 151to1 Medvedev and Fleurian drew each other a second time 
When I saw the new draw I did nt have to change my preparation Medvedev said 
I think it s destined that it turned out for me

TENNIS GRAF WORKS HARD FOR FIRSTROUND WIN 
Bill Berkrot 
NEW YORK dashnum 
It was nt supposed to be this hard for defending champion Steffi Graf to win her opening match at the US Open on Tuesday night 
But the script that called for the usual firstround demolition by the topranked top seed was rewritten by 29thranked Indonesian Yayuk Basuki playing with nothing to lose abandon 
Graf of course prevailed dashnum dashnum but not before some tense moments that even had the German superstar thinking the match was going three sets 
I won the second set which I did nt think I would do being down dashnum and the chances she had at dashnum Graf recalled 
Several of the other women s seeds eased into the second round with more typical Graflike efficiency Tuesday 
As afternoon turned to evening fourthseeded Spaniard Conchita Martinez took apart Romanian Ruxandra Dragomir in num minutes with the loss of just two games one more than second seed Monica Seles who opened the secondday programme by crushing American Anne Miller dashnum dashnum 
Third seed Arantxa Sanchez Vicario the year champion and eighthseeded Olympic gold medalist Lindsay Davenport dropped three game each en route to the second round 
But the day was not without its seeded casualties on the women s side 
Fifthseed Iva Majoli of Croatia was picked off by Austrian Judith Wiesner and Wimbledon semifinalist Kimiko Date of Japan the 10th seed fell dashnum dashnum to 53rdranked American Kimberly Po 
Date s defeat left no other seeded players in Seles s quarter of the draw which lost Anke Huber num and Maggie Maleeva num on Monday 
But Graf winner of num Grand Slam titles was not about to join that list 
At some points I felt a little nervous she admitted 
When it came down to the important points I felt more confident 
Basuki a firstround loser here for the fifth consecutive year was clearly going for winners hitting the lines and running Graf around the court as she broke the top seed twice in the second set to grab that shocking dashnum lead 
Graf ran off the next three games to restore some semblance of order 
But Basuki her long black ponytail flying as she raced for shots held her serve and twice had set point on Graf s serve at dashnum before the German unleashed a forehand pass to force the tiebreak 
I lost the moment lamented Basuki who has reached the fourth round at Wimbledon four times and was a semifinalist in Montreal earlier this month 
Still the feisty Indonesian got off to a dashnum lead in the tiebreaker before a pair of costly double faults gave Graf her chance to avoid a third set 
Usually in the first one or two matches you want to find your rhythm and want to get into it said Graf who won seven of the last eight points in the breaker 
To be in that situation today a couple of times having to play well get down and play pointbypoint definitely is a good start

Marcelo signed in close season to replace compatriot Ronaldo who left to play for Barcelona opened the PSV scoring in the 19th minute when he fired home after good work from Rene Eijkelkamp

Former England manager Bobby Robson enjoyed his first success in charge of Barcelona as his team weathered num minutes of nonstop Atletico Madrid pressure to win the Spanish Super Cup dashnum on aggregate on Wednesday 
Barcelona had won the first leg dashnum but the second leg was a different story 
Atletico came within a whisker of taking the Cup on the awaygoal rule but squandered several chances after going dashnum ahead num minutes from the end 
Juan Lopez gave Atletico the lead midway through the first half after Barcelona fullback Albert Ferrer and substitute goalkeeper Julen Lopetegui failed to clear a Milinko Pantic cross 
Barcelona s Hristo Stoichkov made his only significant contribution of the evening num minutes after halftime when Sergi Barjuan broke down the right to set up the fiery Bulgarian with a simple equaliser 
But Atletico struck back almost immediately through new signing Juan Eduardo Esnaider and then Serbian setpiece specialist Pantic made it dashnum with a superb freekick in the 75th minute 
Robson praised Atletico after the game which was played in the Community of Madrid athletic stadium because of pitch problems at the Vicente Calderon ground 
The venue of Atletico s first league game scheduled for Sunday is still in doubt with the Real Madrid s Santiago Bernabeu a distinct possibility

Roma now coached by Argentine Carlos Bianchi and watched by Italian national coach Arrigo Sacchi lost dashnum to Cesena another repeat of last season when the Rome club also went out at the first hurdle 
Udinese with Germany s Euro num hero Oliver Bierhoff in their lineup completed the hattrick of beaten serie A sides when they went under dashnum to newly relegated Cremonese

SOCCER SMICER S LASTGASP GOAL KEEPS LENS IN THE LEAD 
PARIS dashnum 
Euro num star Vladimir Smicer of the Czech Republic scored at the last second for Lens allowing them to retain the lead in the French soccer league on Wednesday 
Smicer pushed the ball home in injury time to lead his team to a dashnum victory over Montpellier who were leading dashnum until Cameroon s MarcVivien Foe equalised on a header in the 85th minute 
The win was the fourth in as many matches this season for Lens who lead the table on num points 
Inform Paris St Germain who dismissed Nantes dashnum are second with num points 
Along with Smicer Robert Pires was the star of the night in France scoring the first hattrick of the league season in Metz s dashnum home victory over neighbouring Strasbourg 
Pires one of the most promising strikers in the country was called up for the first time this week by French manager Aime Jacquet for a friendly against Mexico on Saturday at the Parc des Princes 
Pires scored first with a powerful shot in the 35th minute before striking again from close range just before the break 
A solitary raid allowed him to score his third in the 74th 
Smicer s goal was as hardwon as his team s victory 
Spurred by Foe s leveller five minutes before Lens pressed hard and Foe hit the crossbar in the dying seconds on another header 
The ball bounced back to Smicer s feet and he scored 
Montpellier seized an unexpected lead thanks to Kader Ferhaoui in the fourth minute after a blunder from Lens goalkeeper JeanClaude Nadon 
The side from northern France forced to fight an uphill battle from then on pulled level thanks to Tony Vairelles in the eighth minute but young striker Fabien Lefevre made it two for Montpellier five minutes later 
League favourites PSG scored a convincing dashnum win over Nantes and confirmed they would again be the team to beat this season 
Ironically PSG s victory owed a lot to two former Nantes players striker Patrice Loko who scored on a brilliant shot in the 33rd minute and defender Benoit Cauet who started the onetwo which allowed Loko to score 
The Parisians who have yet to concede a goal were without Brazil s Leonardo and Panama s Julio Cesar Dely Valdes both called up by their national sides 
For Nantes who shocked PSG to win the league crown two years ago the fall is very painful 
The Canaries who lost most of their key players within two years have yet to win a match this season 
Reigning champions Auxerre had to settle for a goalless draw against Marseille on Tuesday

Organisers hope to persuade Britain s former Olympic num metres champion Linford Christie to join a Dream Team sprint relay in a special tribute to Jesse Owens at Friday s Berlin grand prix 
Christie who is retiring from international competition at the end of the season was not due to compete in the German capital but Berlin promoter Rudi Thiel said We are still hopeful of getting him to come 
Thiel has managed to get most of the Olympic num metres champions since year to attend the meeting which is being held in the stadium where Owens won four gold medals num years ago at the Berlin Olympics 
Canada s Donovan Bailey the Olympic num metres champion and world record holder and Namibian Frankie Fredericks the silver medallist at the recent Atlanta Games have already agreed to run in the 4X100 metres team 
Thiel said on Wednesday that he had also asked Olympic year and num champion Michael Johnson to run as well as Christie 
Most of the Olympic champions of the past are coming including Britain s year champion Allan Wells 
Christie belongs to them 
It would be great to have him here 
There is a good offer 
My minimum would be that he just ran the relay he said 
The 36yearold Briton is still considering the offer and is expected to announce his decision later on Wednesday 
Owens s widow Ruth is not well enough to attend but a message from her will be read out during the meeting and one of the sprinter s relatives is expected to attend 
The relay race which will include squads from Africa the United States and Europe as well as the Owens quartet will be held at the end of the meeting 
Organisers had hoped to include year and year champion Carl Lewis in the squad but he injured himself in Brussels last Friday

SAFRICAN TRUTH BODY TO SUMMON APARTHEID POLICE 
CAPE TOWN dashnum 
South Africa s Truth and Reconciliation Commission said on Wednesday it would subpoena persons accused of human rights violations to appear before it 
We can subpoena anyone we want to even the president of the country spokesman John Allen told Reuters 
Subpoenas are due to be served on a number of people this week 
Media reports have speculated that the commission which is trying to heal the wounds of apartheid by confronting the past could subpoena apartheidera President PW Botha and former police generals Basie Smit and Johan Van Der Merwe 
In submissions last week to the commission National Party leader and former president FW De Klerk said he had received no cooperation from Botha in compiling his party s report 
Since it began work in April the commission has been hearing harrowing tales from the victims of apartheidera abuses by both the white minority regime and its opponents 
It also wants to hear from those who committed the abuses to whom it can offer amnesty in return for frankness 
Hopes that reformed perpetrators would come forward voluntarily have faded but the commission has the legal power to force them to appear 
Allen declined to give say who would be subpoenaed 
At the moment we have a preliminary list of less than num people but this is just the beginning he said 
The commission was set up last year to probe num years of humanrights violations during the apartheid era 
It is chaired by Nobel Peace winner retired Archbishop Desmond Tutu 
Allen said the commission could announce the names of subpoenaed persons on Monday next week

In order to help him decide whether he should hear the case a US District Court judge Wednesday ordered the legal counsels of Biogen Inc and Berlex Laboratories a subsidiary of Schering AG deposed 
The tempest beyond the test tube involves allegations that the US Food and Drug Administration violated the Orphan Drug law by allowing Biogen the right to sell its multiple sclerosis drug Avonex 
Berlex also charges that Avonex is so similar to its MS drug Betaseron that it is a patent infringement 
Both drugs are types of interferon 
One analyst said sales of Avonex had already cut into Betaseron market share 
BioVest Research Inc s analyst Eddie Hedaya said Berlex sales are losing share like mad 
my understanding of the marketplace is that they re below expectations 
He added Chiron Corp reported its sales of inventory to Berlex was down 
Chiron makes Betaseron Berlex markets it he said 
Biogen in its Securities and Exchange Commission quarterly report for the period ending June num said it had earned num million from Avonex sales during the drugs first six weeks on the market 
When it approved Avonex in May the FDA said both Biogen s product and Betaseron were developed under the incentives of the Ophran Drug Act which provides seven years of marketing exclusivity for products that treat rare diseases 
Avonex has been allowed to enter the market because it differs from interferon beta1b Betaseron 

the FDA said 
Now US District Judge Mark Wolf has ordered the chief counsel for Biogen Michael Astrue and Robert Chabora his counterpart at Berlex be deposed about a May num meeting the two men attended to help him determine whether the lawsuit filed by Biogen against Berlex should be heard in Massachusetts 
Berlex filed a lawsuit against Biogen in US District Court in Newark NJ in July but Biogen had already filed a suit against Berlex in Massachusetts in May 
Wolf ordered the depositions to determine if he or US District Judge John Bissell of Newark should preside over the case

For the most part they really did nt understand what was going on the director of the Nagyatad camp Lajos Horvath told Reuters on Wednesday 
It was confusing they had no experience of voting many of the refugees are only semiliterate and none of them knew anything about the candidates he said 
They just voted along ethnic lines where they could 
The Bosnian election is set for September num and voting began on Wednesday for most of the num Bosnians living abroad 
The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe which is running the election allowed the ballot to be held on Sunday in four Hungarian refugee camps 
Some Moslem refugees among the num registered voters Hungary s largest camp Nagyatad have written to the OSCE complaining that they were unable to vote in contests for the president or assembly of the BosnianCroat Federation where most Moslems live 
This was because their prewar homes are now in the Serbcontrolled territory so they were voting for the national assembly of the Republika Srbska most of the candidates for which are Serbs 
For the foreign powers which back last year s Dayton peace agreement the main point of the election rules is that by voting as though they were still in their prewar homes Bosnians should override the effects of ethnic cleansing and reassert the concept of a single multiethnic state 
But Adem Hodzic one of the refugees who signed the letter of complaint told Reuters 
We only realised after voting that we were being denied the rights of other Bosnian Moslems to choose our president 
This vote seals the division of my country 
Under the election rules citizens vote for a threeman presidency and House of Representatives for all BosniaHercegovina and for assemblies and cantonal seats in either the MoslemCroat Federation or the Republika Srbska 
On Sunday voters in Hungary also cast ballots for municipal councils but these will be invalidated following the cancellation of local elections by the OSCE on Tuesday 
Husein Micijevic who also signed the letter alleged that elderly voters were directed who to vote for by Hungarian translators who stood in the polling booth to help them 
Probably num refugees were shown where to put their cross he said 
Seventy eightyearold Mandolina Zelic a Bosnian Croat who has spent the last five years in Nagyatad told Reuters she had cast her ballot because she d been told to by the camp authorities but had no idea who she voted for 
At first the organisers would nt let anyone help me but when they saw I did nt understand a young translator ringed the names I had to mark she said 
I do nt know who I voted for 
Maria Szabo of the Hungarian office organising the elections on behalf of the OSCE told Reuters on Wednesday her office was studying the letter but said they had followed OSCE instructions very carefully 
The envelopes each with the five different voting slips were sealed until voting and had written instructions on how to vote she said

Lebed likely to fail on Chechnya Polish minister 
WARSAW dashnum 
Russian security chief Aleksander Lebed faces an almost impossible task in Chechnya and is likely to be sidelined Polish Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati was reported as saying on Wednesday 
According to bestselling daily Gazeta Wyborcza Rosati told the Polish parliament s foreign affairs committee on Tuesday that the fact Lebed had been charged with resolving the conflict in Chechnya showed he would be marginalised 
It is almost impossible to gain success in this it quoted Rosati as saying during a committee debate 
Lebed has no diplomatic experience 
Yeltsin sent him there to compromise him 
This tactical manoeuvre also shows that in the ruling circle there is no unity of action he said 
Lebed who has arranged a military truce with separatist rebels in the southern Russia region was in Moscow this week seeking support for a deal on Chechnya s political status 
But Russian President Boris Yeltsin has seemed unwilling to meet his envoy and went on holiday on Monday 
Gazeta Wyborcza quoted Rosati as saying Yeltsin was very ill and effectively on leave but for now retained control in Russia although matters were passing into the hands of his close collaborators 
Rosati said Russia s July polls in which Yeltsin won reelection showed democracy had passed an important test and the Russian people had chosed the path of further reforms 
But he said a power struggle in Russia s ruling circles could not be ruled out which could harm further reforms 
He expressed concern over problems in the Russian economy saying this could lead to social unrest the daily reported 
On Moscow s foreign policy Rosati said it had changed its stance on NATO s eastward expansion and was preparing itself for Poland s inevitable entry into the Western alliance 
He also reportedly criticised Russian Foreign Minister Yevgeny Primakov saying his style of work resembled that of the Sovietera 1970s and 1980s

The Costa Rican government said on Wednesday that a Dutch couple abducted over the weekend from a tree farm in northern Costa Rica was kidnapped by former Nicaraguan guerrillas 
Even though it s an act of common delinquency the case could take a difficult turn because former Nicaraguan guerrillas are involved Security Minister Bernardo Arce told reporters 
Earlier this year a German tourist and a Swiss tour guide were kidnapped from the same general area in northern Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border 
They were held for num days before relatives paid a ransom to free them 
Two Nicaraguan former guerrillas have been arrested in the case 
Because of the apparent threat to foreigners in Costa Rica near the Nicaraguan border Arce said the government has advised many to take additional security measures on their own 
Hurte Sierd Zylstra and his wife Jetsi Hendrika Coers both num years old were seized late on Saturday or early on Sunday from a teak tree plantation they manage by at least two heavily armed men who took the two off in their own car leaving behind a ransom note demanding num million 
The plantation is owned by Dutch citizen Ebe Huizinga who has since arrived in Costa Rica to deal with the matter

Govt dodging extradition Colombian official says 
BOGOTA Colombia dashnum 
A top judicial official and critic of President Ernesto Samper accused the government of indifference on Wednesday over efforts to lift Colombia s fiveyearold ban on extradition 
It would seem that the subject of extradition is unworthy of an opinion from the government Deputy ProsecutorGeneral Adolfo Salamanca said 
Constitutional reforms were proposed on Tuesday by two senators one of them a member of Samper s own Liberal Party aimed at lifting the ban on extradition introduced in year 
US Ambassador Myles Frechette applauded the move saying it could prompt the Clinton administration to remove Colombia from a list of outcast nations that have failed to cooperate in US counternarcotics efforts 
Samper who weathered a yearold crisis stemming from charges he financed his year election campaign with drug money appeared less than enthusiastic however 
Extradition is not on the government s legislative agenda he told reporters on Tuesday 
He added that he did not oppose the idea of opening a public debate over the issue 
But he fell far short of endorsing the idea of putting Colombian drug lords onto USbound flights to serve stiff penalities in American prisons 
Salamanca who spoke at a meeting on kidnapping in Colombia has said in the past that there was ample evidence to prove that Samper s campaign received millions of dollars in contributions from the country s top drug lords

Dole blasts Clinton for ignoring teen drug use

Republican presidential candidate Bob Dole Wednesday accused the Clinton administration of ignoring drug use among teenagers and said if elected he would use the National Guard to stop drugs from entering the United States 
He ll probably mention his war on drugs which he s going to start like everything else next year 
It s too late Mr President Dole told an outdoor crowd of several hundred at a private religious school 
He also commented briefly on published reports that the administration was planning to announce a plan to lower capital gains taxes for home sales 
Welcome to the club 
We ve had it out there for weeks and weeks and weeks Dole said 
Dole said former first lady Nancy Reagan was laughed at with her just say no antidrug message 
But it worked Dole said 
Meanwhile in Los Angeles Dole s running mate Jack Kemp campaigned aggressively for the black vote in an area that was the flashpoint of the year Los Angeles riots 
Kemp told a crowd of about num African Americans in south central Los Angeles Keep your eyes open keep your ears open keep your heart open 
I want to tell you with all my heart that we want to win your vote 
In Dole s address to a group that was largely white the presidential nominee likened the stream of illegal drugs into the United States to missiles aimed at American children and promised to appoint federal judges who would be tough on illegal drug use 
They re aiming millions and millions of missiles right at these young people whether it s a needle whether it s a cigarette whatever the delivery system is it s poison and it s got to stop in America 
he said 
Dole said num percent of the cocaine that entered the United States and num percent of the marijuana came from Mexico 
We ve got an international problem and I m prepared to use our military might 
We want to stop drugs at the border he said 
Dole s remarks prompted questions about whether he was seeking a ban on cigarettes 
I did nt say anything about cigarettes 
I was talking about drugs 
I said you should nt smoke either 
That s all I said he replied as he was shaking hands with wellwishers 
When asked specifically if he was suggesting a ban on cigarettes Dole replied Oh no 
Come on you know better than that 
Dole campaign aides said the candidate was telling young people not to smoke 
Dole also said he opposed California Proposition num which if approved by voters would allow the cultivation of marijuana plants for medicinal uses 
Dole said the initiative would allow marijuana to be used for anything from a headache to an ingrown toenail 
In an effort to paint the drug issue in nonpolitical terms Dole said three times during his 20minute address that illegal drug use was neither a Democratic nor a Republican issue but one that involves all people 
The antidrug message is a theme Dole feels has strong voter appeal 
On Sunday near Chicago he accused President Bill Clinton of raising the white flag in the war on drugs 
A recent survey showed that illegal drug use among dashnum yearolds had doubled in the past four years 
Dole was flanked by several California Republican politicians including Gov 
Pete Wilson who said local and state governments cannot fight illegal drugs alone 
We need all the help we can get 
We need to get the kind of help we used to get when Ronald Reagan and George Bush were in the White House Wilson said

Abovenormal summer rainfall in the US High Plains has produced nearideal conditions for planting the year hard red winter wheat crop analysts said Wednesday 
From central Texas north to Kansas rains throughout July and August have relieved most of the drought conditions that plagued the region earlier this year 
Our moisture situation is excellent especially for fall planting of winter wheat said Kim Anderson extension wheat marketing economist at Oklahoma State University 
The irony of the aboveaverage summer rainfall was not lost on High Plains wheat producers who only three months ago were caught in a drought so severe that oldtimers likened conditions to the Dust Bowl days of the 1930s 
It s definitely a turnabout from this past year but you know last year we had pretty good moisture about this time of year and then about October num it quit said Mark Hodges executive director of the Oklahoma Wheat Commission 
Hopefully that s not going to happen this year 
According to figures released by the Oklahoma Climatological Survey an average of num inches fell across the state between March num and August num year 
That s about fraction inch above the average for the same time period according to Howard Johnson associate state climatologist at the University of Oklahoma 
He noted that the majority of that num inches had fallen since July 
As an example of just how dry it was data showed that between October num year and March num year the state received an average of only num inches of rainfall 
In northern Texas the current rainfall situation was similar to most of Oklahoma said Rodney Mosier executive assistant for the Texas Wheat Producers 
Up here in the Texas Panhandle we ve had some extremely beneficial rains that came through within the last several days and are really setting us up for ideal conditions for planting wheat Mosier said 
But he warned that the situation was not as ideal in central and southern Texas where mositure levels were still short despite the rains brought by Hurricane Dolly last week 
In Kansas typically the number one US hard red winter wheat producer topsoil moisture levels were rated mostly adequate during the week ended Sunday according to the state s agricultural statistics service

Burundi defends military regime to hostile UN

Burundi s ambassador on Wednesday lashed out at economic sanctions imposed by African states and said any thought of an arms embargo would be a windfall for guerrillas fighting his armyrun government 
In a lengthy debate on Burundi before the UN Security Council Ambassador Nsanze Terence said the new military government took over to stabilise the country and wanted negotiations under former Tanzanian President Julius Nyrere 
Nearly every African member who spoke as well as most Security Council members however were unsympathetic towards the government of President Pierre Buyoya an army major put in power in a July coup by the Tutsirun military which is locked in a guerrilla war with the majority Hutus 
These African brothers should have been the first to bind the wounds of Burundi Terence said of the economic embargo 
Quite the contrary Burundi has seen economic war declared against it by fellow African people a gratuitous immolation of the people of Burundi 
He said his government had just asked UN human rights monitors to increase their numbers in Burundi in an effort to put an end to this vicious circle of violence 
More than num people have been killed in violence between the minority Tutsis and the majority Hutus since year 
Botswana s envoy Mothusi Nkgowe said coups should be relegated to the dump heap of history as there could be no justification for the overthrow of a legitimate government 
Chile has proposed a resolution still under discussion that would impose an immediate arms embargo on Burundi and call for negotiations 
The draft suggests further sanctions against those who impede a political solution 
Among the council s five permanent members Russia and the United States appeared to support most elements of the Chilean proposal while Britain France and China were cautious 
Terence a Tutsi said any arms embargo would leave the army unable to defend itself against Hutu guerrillas and leave the population exposed to armed terroritsts 
But Chilean Ambassador Juan Somavia said Every weapon that reached Burundi is a weapon aimed mainly at killing an unarmed civilian 
We must not send a signal different from the African leaders themselves 
Inaction is becoming the worst possible course of action 
Burundi s parliament has been suspended and political parties are banned but Terence told reporters Buyoya would reconvene a new type of national assembly in October 
The United States said the coup leaders had taken no steps to restore democracy and indiscriminate killings continued 
Ambassador Karl Inderfurth said the new government should have unconditional negotiations with all parties inside and outside of the country 
He said Washington strongly supported the economic sanctions imposed already and if these did not work the council would consider an arms embargo or targeted sanctions against faction leaders 
But he said the international community had to be prepared for the worst and avoid a replay of the horrors in neighbouring Rwanda where widespread genocide broke out against the Tutsis two years ago 
He again said the United Nations should draw up contingency plans for a rapid humanitarian intervention

The Indian government has warned its fishermen that their boats would be impounded if they were caught ferrying refugees 
The fishermen went on strike last week to protest the government s cancellation of three trawlers fishing licenses after the boats were caught carrying Tamil refugees 
All Fishermen s Association secretary NJ Bose said the strike would continue indefinitely and the fishermen would block road and rail traffic if their demands were not met 
Until the government releases our boats from naval custody and Sri Lankan naval custody and gives us assurance it will not revoke licences of boats ferrying refugees we will not call off our strike Bose said 
LTTE spokesmen could not immediately be reached for comment but Sri Lankan fishermen denied that Indians were being coerced into carrying refugees across the Palk Strait 
Indian fishermen come right up to Pesalai to fish and when refugees request them to ferry them across they readily oblige 
Only some take money Sri Lankan boatman Chinnathambi said 
Arulanandam denied the fishermen charged the refugees for passage to India and said it was unfair to penalise them for the refugees arrival 
We have not gone to sea since August num but refugees are arriving daily nevertheless 
How could we alone be held responsible for the influx

Later in the day helped by the firmer Wall Street opening Paris climbed back to the year level but still remained well into negative territory 
In foreign exchange the dollar was trading at around num yen in the European afternoon up from its European close on Tuesday of num but off the day s highs 
It had been boosted overnight by the Bank of Japan s quarterly corporate survey or tankan of major manufacturers an important gauge of business sentiment 
The unexpectedly weak figures convinced markets that Japanese interest rates would stay at rockbottom levels weakening the yen 
The Japanese discount rate is currently at a record low of num percent 
The BOJ sought to put the best face on the data which defied economists predictions of improving sentiment and was the first decline in business sentiment in a year 
A BOJ spokesman said the doors to the recovery have not been shut 
the recovery is still continuing 
These remarks gave the yen some backbone and the dollar failed to progress further 
The dollar s gains were less than spectacular suggesting that while it s likely to benefit from revised Japanese rate expectations a breakout from the established trading range does nt appear likely said currency economist Klaus Baader 
Dealers said shares were also affected by a slippage in bond prices due to lower than expected June industrial production showing the economy was still faltering

Arafat says Israel declares war on Palestinians 
Wafa Amr 
RAMALLAH West Bank dashnum 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat said on Wednesday that Israel had declared war on the Palestinians and called for the first general strike in the West Bank and Gaza in two years 
What happened concerning continuous violations and crimes from this new Israeli leadership means they are declaring a state of war against the Palestinian people Arafat told the Palestinian legislature 
Accusing Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of stupidity Arafat launched his strongest attack on the rightwing government since its election in May 
The tirade was sparked by Israel s announcement on Tuesday of plans to expand the Jewish settlement of Kiryat Sefer and its demolishing of a community centre in Arab East Jerusalem 
Israel has started the war on Jerusalem 
They are idiots to have started the Jerusalem battle Arafat said in Arabic 
There will be no Palestinian state without Jerusalem 
Netanyahu should know he is stupid to have started this battle 
Arafat called for a general strike for Jerusalem on Thursday in all of the West Bank and Gaza Strip 
There has not been a joint shutdown there since May year when Israeli troops began withdrawing under an interim selfrule agreement signed in year 
The strike will have little effect on the Israeli economy while hurting Palestinian merchants in East Jerusalem and Bethlehem who cater to the tourist trade 
Some num Palestinian labourers are likely to stay away from their jobs mainly in construction in Israel 
But Palestinians once the backbone of the building industry have been largely replaced by labourers from Romania and China 
On Friday all Moslems including Palestinians in Israel 
will go to Jerusalem s AlAqsa mosque and pray 
Jews and Christians who do not pray should accompany them and stand behind them Arafat said 
Officials in Netanyahu s office were not immediately available for comment on Arafat s remarks 
Israeli travel restrictions imposed after bombings by Moslem militants in February and March ban most of the two million Arabs in the West Bank and Gaza from entering Jerusalem 
Netanyahu who opposes trading occupied land for peace made Jerusalem a central issue in his election campaign accusing Labour Prime Minister Shimon Peres of planning to hand control of the Arab eastern part of the city to the Palestinians 
Israel captured East Jerusalem in the year Middle East war and claims both halves of the city as its capital 
The PLO wants East Jerusalem as the capital of a future Palestinian state 
In his speech to the crowded legislature Arafat signalled he was not abandoning diplomacy although alarm bells are ringing 
He unexpectedly broke off his address to take a telephone call from US Middle East envoy Dennis Ross who held talks in Paris on Tuesday with Israeli and Egyptian officials 
When Arafat returned to the podium he said senior PLO negotiator Mahmoud Abbas better known as Abu Mazen and Netanyahu aide Dore Gold could meet on Thursday 
He quoted Ross as telling him The important thing is the Israelis are prepared to move 
Arafat said he replied is this like their previous promises 
No they have good intentions Arafat quoted Ross as saying 
Palestinians have been pressing Israel to carry out a longdelayed partial troop pullout from the flashpoint West Bank city of Hebron agreed by the previous Labour government 
The Israeli government is studying redeployment plans submitted by Defence Minister Yitzhak Mordechai which are likely to demand a wider than agreed army presence in Hebron

US investors mull appeal of Lloyd s decision 
Patricia Vowinkel 
NEW YORK dashnum 
US investors in troubled Lloyd s of London were considering late on Tuesday whether to appeal a US court decision in favour of Lloyd s and pledged to continue pursuing other legal actions 
A US appeals court on Tuesday gave Lloyd s a reprieve throwing out an injunction that the insurance giant said could have led to its collapse 
A lower court issued the injunction on Friday and ordered Lloyd s to give investors known as Names more information before requiring them to decide whether to accept a settlement offer as part of a reorganisation plan 
My prediction is that the Names will appeal said Kenneth Chiate a US Name and a chief negotiator for the American Names Association 
At this point it is a sufficiently important decision that I m confident that they will appeal he said 
But to say that they definitely will would be premature until we determine what the exact basis for the court s ruling is 
Under the reorganisation plan Lloyd s plans to reinsure its massive liabilities into a new company called Equitas 
The arrangement calls for investors to make additional payments to fund Equitas but also provides them with num billion stg in compensation to help reduce their prior outstanding liabilities 
The Names had been scheduled to decide whether to accept or reject the offer by num GMT Wednesday but Lloyd s chairman David Rowland said on Tuesday the offer would be extended 
At least eight US states have still some form of litigation pending said John Head spokesman for the Association of Lloyd s State Chairmen a group representing US Names 
It goes without saying that we re rather disappointed Head said of the decision by the US Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit sitting in Baltimore 
But he said we still have hope that somebody is going to see our point of view in this 
The Colorado attorney general told Lloyd s last week it was considering a new legal action against the British insurance market based on allegations of consumer fraud 
We have notified them of our concerns and asked them to give us a response said Colorado attorney general Gale Norton 
Norton said she was concerned that the Lloyd s agreement immunizes it from future litigation regarding Equitas and requires that all legal actions be heard outside of Colorado 
In addition she said she was concerned the plan may not offer investors enough protection from additional future liabilities 
Meanwhile an appeal of a lawsuit filed by some num Names in California is still pending before the US Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit Chiate of the American Names Association said 
That lawsuit which seeks rescision and restitution was dismissed in a US district court 
That case is what I call the most significant alternate remedy for us Chiate said 
The individual Names however now must decide whether to accept Lloyd s settlement offer or reject the offer and pursue litigation 
Chiate said he has advised Names that they must make individually a risk benefit analysis 
Rejection involved forfeiting the compensation offer and risking the possibility of owing Lloyd s two to three times more than Lloyd s is now willing to accept he said 
But in rejecting the offer the Names would retain their rights to pursue litigation he said

Japan coalition party leader plans to resign 
TOKYO dashnum 
The leader of a junior partner in Japan s threeparty ruling coalition plans to resign to quell a political rebellion party officials said on Wednesday 
The officials said New Party Sakigake President Masayoshi Takemura finance minister until the beginning of this year promised his resignation in a meeting with the politician who set off the rebellion in the smallest coalition member 
They said the date of Takemura s resignation would be determined by party officials 
The Sakigake row has caused jitters in its coalition partners Prime Minister Ryutaro Hashimoto s Liberal Democratic Party LDP the biggest grouping and the Social Democratic Party 
But analysts said the row was not expected to immediately destabilise the government as even if Sakigake splits apart it has so few seats a loss of support would not lead to a general election 
The dispute pits Takemura who founded Sakigake in year as a reformoriented LDP splinter group against party official Yukio Hatoyama who says he will leave Sakigake to form a reformist political group next month 
Hatoyama the 49yearold grandson of a 1950s prime minister on Tuesday quit as Sakigake secretary general and has publicly snubbed the 62yearold Takemura pointedly ruling his mentor out as a possible member of the new political force 
Marathon talks between the two former allies on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning failed to resolve the dispute over the role of Takemura seen by Hatoyama backers as tainted by his senior role in the LDPdominated coalition 
The presence of Takemura whose role as finance minister in passing an unpopular plan to use taxpayer funds to wind up failed housing loan firms ruined his reputation as a reformer has stalled Hatoyama s efforts to attract to his new group defectors from the opposition camp analysts said 
Media reports say that at most num of num Sakigake members joined by a handful of Social Democrats will follow Hatoyama when he bolts far short of the num lawmakers needed to topple Hashimoto s eightmonthold government 
Hashimoto who returns from a 10day Latin American tour on Saturday must call polls by mid1997 and has repeatedly said he would not call an early general election

Iraq balks at UN staff for oilforfood deal 
Evelyn Leopold 
UNITED NATIONS dashnum 
Iraq has balked at the number of UN staff needed to implement the oilforfood deal blaming the United States for insisting on stringent monitoring 
In comments to reporters and a statement on Tuesday Iraqi diplomats said the cost of the monitors and other staff which Baghdad has to finance surpasses funds allocated for electricity water sewers education and agriculture 
At issue was a May num agreement allowing Iraq to sell num billion worth of oil to purchase badly needed food medicine and other supplies to ease the impact of sanctions in force since its troops invaded Kuwait in August year 
The Iraqi statement said the United States was interfering and pressing to augment the number of international staff and this is not legal and not justified 
Iraq s deputy ambassador Saeed Hasan noted that the May num accord said that the number of personnel would be determined by the United Nations and that the government of Iraq would be consulted 
Saeed in his comments did not threaten to call off the deal and the UN officials said they expected it to go into force next month after SecretaryGeneral Boutros BoutrosGhali reports that arrangements are in place 
The UN Department of Humanitarian Affairs DHA which has to coordinate the distribution of food medicine and other goods increased the number of monitors earlier this month at the insistence of the United States 
According to UN officials and diplomats Iraq would have about num billion to spend for food medicine and other goods after monies for a reparations fund for Gulf War victims and costs for UN weapons inspections were deducted 
The cost of the UN staff overseeing the distribution of food and other supplies was estimated to cost num million 
In addition another num million was anticipated to cover other expenses such as oil experts and administrative costs 
For the distribution and supervision of humanitarian supplies the United Nations estimated it needed num people including num international staff and num Iraqi support staff 
Of this number num foreign and num local staff would be in the northern Kurdish provinces no longer the direct control of the Baghdad government 
Another year international staff and num Iraqis would run the programme in the central and southern parts of the country 
There are also num monitors to watch oil flows num customs experts and four New Yorkbased oil experts or overseers to approve contracts 
Yasushi Akashi the DHA undersecretarygeneral told the Security Council last week that the financial requirements to support the humanitarian programme represent a very modest percentile of the total

EU Commission cool on changing beef cull plan 
BRUSSELS dashnum 
The European Commission said on Thursday it would study scientific reports saying Britain s mad cow epidemic would die out by year but offered little prospect the findings would change an agreed slaughter campaign 
Obviously we are interested in this research 
We will ask the EU scientific and veterinary committee to examine it Commission spokesman Gerard Kiely told Reuters 
But he added that new research into the dynamics of the bovine spongiform encephalopathy BSE a fatal brainwasting disease suffered by cattle was unlikely to alter a slaughter plan agreed by Britain and its num EU partners 
We agreed that following detailed scientific analysis using a methodology which would take out the maximum number of BSE cases possible 
I think it would be very difficult to sell to the European Commission a programme which would involve the elimination of fewer BSE cases Kiely said 
We will look at our approach to the plan but we wo nt get involved with the number of animals to be slaughtered he said 
We have always avoided the question of numbers of animals to be slaughtered that s not the issue 
The issue is the protection of consumers health and the rapid eradication of BSE he added 
The reaction is likely to disappoint British farmers who seized on research by Oxford scientists in the scientific journal Nature saying it would be hard to get rid of the disease any faster than year without killing vast numbers of cattle 
The researchers predicted there would be num new infections and num new cases of BSE before year 
British farmers leader called on Wednesday for an urgent meeting with ministers to discuss the report 
I hope the government will now make it clear they believe there is a better way of dealing with this issue National Farmers Union president Sir David Naish told BBC radio 
Naish said there was no need for Britain to carry out a planned cull of some num cattle to which it had reluctantly agreed to placate its European partners 
The new evidence to me means some of that proposal should be reexamined because we could get away with considerably less animals being culled if in fact scientists throughout Europe accepted this evidence Naish said 
The report could well reopen a damaging row between Britain and the EU which slapped a worldwide ban on British beef after the government said there could be a link between BSE and the human form of the disease 
The issue flared in in March when government scientists admitted that people could become infected with CreutzfeldtJakob Disease CJD from eating BSEinfected beef

NEW YORK dashnum 
Conchita Martinez decided that when in New York do as the New Yorkers do and the Spaniard s newfound aggressiveness seems to have put her in the right frame of mind for the US Open

I ve been trying my whole career to be aggressive said the 24yearold Martinez after crushing Tauziat in just over an hour 
What I m trying to do is be aggressive all the time maybe go up to the net a few times like I did tonight 
That would really help 
Martinez the year Wimbledon champion used to struggle at the Open but has come to terms with the noise crowds and chaos 
There is a lot of things that can happen Martinez said about her early difficulties adjusting to tennis on the cement at Flushing Meadows 
Like traffic 
We stay in Manhattan and it s a long way to come 
The crowds they speak louder or they move 
That does nt happen in other Grand Slams 
That s where the real champion wins 
You have to concentrate for these two weeks 
It took Martinez four Opens to get as far as the quarters and another four to match that 
Last year Martinez who finished year ranked second in the world reached the semifinals before bowing out to Monica Seles 
Now she feels she is in the swing of things 
I have my own car now and that helps said Martinez 
Sometimes the transportation they the tournament provide gets a little messed up 
This time it did nt happen 
I do the driving and I love it 
It gets my adrenalin going those taxi drivers 
We change lanes all the time in Barcelona

BELGRADE dashnum 
US envoy John Kornblum met Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic on Thursday in an effort to defuse a growing crisis surrounding Bosnia s postwar elections 
The American diplomat arrived in Belgrade two days after international organisers postponed municipal elections in Bosnia due to irregularities in the registration of Serb refugee voters 
We discussed the decision to postpone the municipal elections and I made clear it was primarily the manipulation of voter registration by the Republika Srpska Bosnian Serb republic which led to this development Kornblum said after three hours of talks 
But he said the United States still believed it was important to go ahead with national elections in Bosnia as scheduled on September num to bolster the peace process 
Kornblum gave no indication that he had won any specific commitment from Milosevic the patron of the Bosnian Serbs to rectify any abuses in the registration process 
Bosnia s Moslem political parties have urged their refugees to boycott the elections until irregularities with voter registration are resolved 
Human rights workers say Serbian and Bosnian Serb authorities coerced refugees to register only in Serbheld territory in Bosnia to solidify the results of wartime expulsions and military conquest 
Serbian officials have denied any abuses occurred during a 10day registration period and the Bosnian Serbs angry at the postponement of municipal elections have threatened to hold local polls on their territory without the international community s blessing 
Kornblum said only elections endorsed by the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE would be legitimate 
As we have said publicly before if there is any effort to do so hold local elections these elections will not be valid he said 
The elections which are valid are those conducted by the international community under the management of the OSCE 
After meeting Milosevic Kornblum flew to the Croatian capital Zagreb 
He was due to head to the Bosnian town of Banja Luka on Friday to meet Bosnian Serb acting president Biljana Plavsic and Bosnian Serb opposition leaders 
He also planned to travel to Sarajevo to oversee the formal dissolution of the separatist Croat ministate in western Bosnia

Thai poll shows military wants PM Banharn out 
BANGKOK dashnum 
Thailand s powerful military thinks the government is dishonest and Prime Minister Banharn Silpaarcha s resignation might solve the nation s political and economic woes an opinion poll showed on Thursday 
Nearly half the num military personnel surveyed in the Rajapat Institute poll suggested that Banharn resign while about num percent thought he should dissolve parliament and num percent thought a cabinet reshuffle could resolve the government s problems 
Banharn who leads a sixparty 13monthold coalition government faces a noconfidence debate in parliament next month 
The prime minister who has already lost one coalition partner this month is expected to have a tough battle in the debate because of infighting in his own party and warnings of more pullouts by other coalition partners 
The poll conducted earlier this month after Banharn s coalition completed one year in office showed the military would prefer General Chatichai Choonhavan a former prime minister who was ousted in a military coup in February year as prime minister 
Defence Minister Chavalit Yongchaiyudh head of coalition member the New Aspiration Party was the second choice for prime minister the poll showed 
Banharn came in last on the list of proposed leaders with less than one percent of the votes 
Nearly twothirds of the people surveyed thought the government was dishonest and insincere and num percent blamed the government s poor performance for the country s economic slowdown 
The opinion of the military in Thailand which has seen num coups or attempted coups since the country switched to parliamentary democracy from absolute monarchy in year always carries weight in the political scene despite officials vows to distance the military from politics

Scandal hits Clinton campaign at vital moment 
Michael Conlon 
CHICAGO dashnum 
President Bill Clinton s triumphal appearance at the Democratic convention a vital moment in his bid for a second term was marred on Thursday by the resignation of a top adviser in a reported sex scandal 
Clinton was at work on the nomination acceptance speech that will launch his 10week reelection campaign when political strategist Dick Morris abruptly announced his resignation on Thursday 
The tabloid Star magazine reported the married Morris had a lengthy affair with a 200anhour prostitute who he allowed to eavesdrop on telephone conversations with Clinton and with whom he shared White House speeches before they were made 
Dick Morris is my friend and he is a superb political strategist Clinton said in a written statement 
I am and always will be grateful for the great contributions he has made to my campaigns and for the invaluable work he has done for me over the last two years 
Morris declined to address the allegations directly in his resignation statement but said he was quitting to avoid becoming a campaign issue 
The surprise development captivated the thousands of reporters at the convention and clearly worried some Democrats who had planned a triumphal celebration of Clinton s lead over Dole in the opinion polls 
Senator Dianne Feinstein a California Democrat called it a big bump in the way of the Clinton campaign 
It comes at the worst possible time on one of the biggest days for the president Feinstein said 
Clinton was to deliver his acceptance speech at the final session of the Democratic Convention opening at num pm EDT midnight GMT 
The 50yearold president has been dogged for years by allegations of financial wrongdoing sexual misconduct and questionable judgment in selecting his advisers 
Republicans hope to seize on the character issue to bolster Clinton s challenger Bob Dole in the final weeks of the campaign 
Speaking in Santa Barbara California Dole did not directly refer to the sexual scandal but said the departure of Morris who had advised Clinton to chart a more centrist political course would make Clinton drift back to the left 
Morris has been trying to make President Clinton a Republican now maybe he ll revert to the liberal Democrat that he really is Dole told reporters 
Clinton will hit the road on Friday for a bus tour across several states in his fight to become the first Democratic incumbent reelected to a second term since the days of Franklin D Roosevelt 
Aides said Clinton planned to spend most of Thursday in his hotel room several miles km from the convention hall working on his speech 
It was apparently neglected on his long whistlestop train trip to the convention during which he revelled in contact with friendly crowds across the country s heartland 
He was also hoarse and was giving his voice a rest 
But first lady Hillary Rodham Clinton told ABC television He s really fired up 
He wants to outline to the American people what he thinks has been accomplished in the last four years and what he would like to see done in the next four years she said 
He s very excited about this convention 
He s excited about the campaign 
But more than that he s very resolute about what he wants to do 
I do nt take anything for granted 
I always expect elections to get close 
I expect to have a great deal of up and down days between now and then she said of the November num election date 
Clinton is leading Dole by as much as num points according to some polls 
The campaign pits Dole a man of quick and withering wit and longtime public service but stilted speaking style against the glib and confident Clinton who has perfected a style that makes direct eye contact with his audience

Researchers report progress in muscular dystrophy 
PHILADELPHIA dashnum 
University of Pennsylvania researchers on Thursday said a new genetherapy technique for treating muscular dystrophy disease had shown progress in laboratory animals 
Word of the findings to be published in the Oct num issue of the journal Human Gene Therapy came in advance of the annual Jerry Lewis Labour Day weekend telethon to raise money for muscular dystrophy research 
Several hurdles must be overcome before the method is used in human trials 
Nevertheless a treatment based on the new strategy may have the potential to benefit many patients the University of Pennsylvania Medical Centre said in a release 
Muscular dystrophy is a fatal illness in which the body s muscle tissue degenerates and is replaced by fat 
Death strikes in early adulthood 
Individuals with the disease have a nonworking version of a gene responsible for producing a crucial muscle protein called dystrophin 
In the study at the University s Institute for Human Gene Therapy researchers altered a commoncold virus to carry a version of the working dystrophin gene 
The virus which also was altered to minimise its susceptibility to the immune system was then injected into the muscle cells of mice bred to lack dystrophin genes 
In the experiment between num to num percent of the muscle fibers in one group of mice produced dystrophin for two weeks before diminishing 
Similar results had been obtained previously in testtube cell cultures but not in live animals the university said 
The university said methods are still needed to make enough of the altered virus to treat humans to further decrease the immunesystem response to the virus and to deliver the virus to human muscle tissue

OJ Simpson hints at more supporting evidence 
Jackie Frank 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
OJ Simpson said on Thursday he was financially broken by his defence against murder charges but he was hopeful new evidence to support him would be available for a civil trial next month 
The former football star was found not guilty by a criminal trial jury last October of the murders of his former wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman in June year 
He now faces a civil suit brought by families of the victims who hold him responsible for the deaths 
He told reporters a court order not to talk about his case kept him from detailing how he has fulfilled his pledge to find the killers 
But he added without elaborating hopefully we will see some things come out in this next trial 
The judge in the civil trial has imposed a sweeping gag order that prohibits lawyers witnesses and parties to the case from discussing it with the media or elsewhere in public 
I would love to speak about everything said Simpson who vowed after his acquittal to find the killers and offered a substantial reward 
His lawyers have said his defence in the civil trial that starts Sept 
num will be that he did not kill the victims 
Simpson said at the hotel news conference his plans include eventually writing another book 
He added that he has had job offers but more have come from abroad than at home 
I m broke 
I am not crying the blues 
I can get along just fine he said 
Whatever you want to send me I need 
He again accused the news media of erroneous reporting on his case but did not signal any plans for lawsuits as he did on Wednesday in an address at a jampacked Washington church 
Contrary to news reports Simpson said he has received support from both blacks and whites 
He again dismissed charges that he had distanced himself from the black community during his successful football and commercial career only to seek their support after he faced murder charges 
A crowd of num paid num a head to hear the former star running back for the Buffalo Bills professional football club and a Football Hall of Fame member on Wednesday night

Sierra Semiconductor jumps on exit plan

Sierra Semiconductor Corp jumped num percent Thursday on the expectation the company would emerge as a smaller but more profitable operation after its planned exit from the computer modem business 
The San Jose Calif company was up 218 at 1138 after its announcement Wednesday that it planned to pull out of the highly competitive modemchip business and focus instead on the fastgrowing market for computer networking equipment 
Certainly the company will be a much smaller company now but it will be a more profitable business said analyst Elias Moosa of Roberston Stephens Co 
But analysts noted that Sierra still has much painful work ahead of it including cutting as many as num jobs from its workforce which currently has num people and building up the business of its PMCSierra unit which makes routing devices and chipsets for highspeed computer networks 
The company has announced plans to take a charge against earnings of num million to num million to write down the value of assets and inventories and cover severance payments 
Scott Randall of Soundview Financial Group said the company likely would have difficulty selling its modemchip business 
Once you announce your intention to exit a business it becomes a complete buyer s market he said 
And he said that while the company is focusing on the fastestgrowing part of its business the market for networking chips has begun to attract the attention of muchlarger players such as International Business Machines Corp 
As the market develops the question is are they able to make that transition to be a much larger company 
Randall said 
Other analysts were more bullish even though the company is expected to shrink to slightly more than half its current size in sales 
It s a positive strategic move said Miles Kan of Hambrecht Quist 
The modem business is a lowmargin commodity business he said 
The company s PMCSierra unit generated num million of the company s num million in sales in the first half of the year compared with num million in sales of modem chips Kan said 
But the PMC unit is far more profitable he said

A freed black man writes to his stillenslaved wife a mother pleads with Abraham Lincoln on behalf of her son and a maimed soldier poses for an official photograph in newly reopened records that bring the US Civil War back to life 
Working in the basement of the National Archives members of the Civil War Conservation Corps are organising the military records of volunteers who fought for the North so that they can be preserved on microfilm 
The faded documents have been stowed away in the Archives since it opened in year and have rarely seen the light of day 
Each soldier s file is a gold mine of information enlistment papers muster rolls medical records discharge certificates letters and photographs 
Since the project began almost two years ago corps volunteers have focused on African American troops preparing records in time for the unveiling in Washington this year of a special memorial to black soldiers who fought in the war 
More than num black soldiers fought and num died 
In one letter a black soldier heading South wrote his wife though great is the present national difficulties yet I look forward to a brighter day when I shall have the oportunity of seeing you in the full enjoyment of freedom 
I would like to no sic if you are still in slavery if you are it will not be long before we shall have crushed the system that now oppreses you for in the course of three months you shall have your liberty 
Great is the outpouring of the coloured people that is now rallying with the heart of lions against the very curse that has separated you and me 
In another letter dated January num a welltodo Washington matron wrote to Lincoln to plead for her son who faced a dishonourable discharge from the Army 
James is a prisoner for a thoughtless act of folly while those who have done nothing for the cause are free she wrote 
Lincoln s notation on the letter read If his colonel will say in writing on this sheet he is willing to receive this man back to the regiment I will pardon and send him 
The soldier was subsequently pardoned 
While the letters speak to the anguish of separation a photograph of a black amputee speaks to the terrible physical cost of the war

Ulysses Grant s papers 
These writings are not only poetic but a linguistic treasure trove 
This is the first generation of African Americans that really can express itself without fear and punishment Simon said 
I think there s probably a whole lot of material that would expand our understanding of the sociology of the war said Edward Smith director of American Studies at American University in Washington 
The war between the North and South raged for nearly four years claimed the lives of half a million Americans and forever seared the nation s consciousness 
Southern records have already been preserved 
They were put on microfilm about num years ago through a grant from the United Daughters of the Confederacy 
The Civil War Conservation Corps is mostly retirees joined by students during the school year 
Director Budge Weidman who has shepherded the project from the beginning predicts it will take up to a decade to complete 
The work was inspired by a National Park Service plan to put computer databases at Civil War battlefields across the country so that Americans might research their ancestors

No one was hurt 
A second device packed with five kg num lbs of explosive was defused before it could go off police said 
The new attacks followed by a day a warning of a new gettough policy by Paris toward the separatists who seek greater autonomy 
Interior Minister JeanLouis Debre under fire for staging secret talks with one of the largest of several rival underground nationalist groups told the daily La Corse in a statement he had given firm orders to police to round up those responsible for the bombings and bring them to justice 
Judges on the island had accused Paris of taking a lax stance on guerrilla violence while conducting secret but widelyreported talks with separatists which have now failed 
The latest bombing close on the heels of the new orders brought charges that police were powerless 
No searches no arrests no police reinforcements visible on the island despite the ministry s promises the daily FranceSoir lamented 
On the island as at the Place Beauvau the Interior Ministry s Paris address people are well aware who is who and who is doing what 
It is time to end this nightly farce said the progovernment daily Le Figaro in an editorial 
No one immediately claimed responsibility for Thursday s incidents which brought to num the number of guerrilla attacks on the resort island since midAugust when separatist guerrillas ended a shaky sevenmonth truce 
Corsica has been racked by lowlevel separatistinspired violence principally directed against government targets for two decades 
The daily Le Monde reported on Wednesday some separatist movements were considering taking their attacks to the French mainland on the principle that num grammes of explosives on the continent have more impact than num kilos in Corsica 
The newspaper said separatists may take advantage of social unrest widely expected on the mainland in coming weeks over government austerity plans to stoke a popular backlash against the government

INTERVIEWTN untroubled by margin pressure 
LONDON dashnum 
The chairman of Britishbased components and engineering group TN Plc said on Thursday the firm remained confident about the general prospects for its operating margins despite pressure from unsettled markets 
In an interview following its firsthalf results which included a less optimistic forecast for the second half of this year than it had made in the past Sir Colin Hope said TN had taken defensive action to protect it from patchy markets 
Looking at market prospects he said I think our best judgment at this stage is that it will probably bumble along in the rather mixed way it s been in the first half 
It s very difficult to predict the market trend this year 
It could be better or it could be worse Hope added echoing the demand uncertainty across automotive industries 
You can see anxieties in Germany and France in particular beginning to grow and develop 
America however is looking a little better he said 
Compared with the end of last year when TN predicted a sluggish first half and a rebound later in year Hope said I think the difference now is the first half has not actually been as bad as some felt it was going to be but equally we re certainly not predicting a recovery in the second half 
Against this background Hope said the group was glad it had rationalised and destocked even though this had pressed margins which had slipped to num percent from num percent a year ago 
I think the figure of num percent on the first half when you consider the fact that we ve been destocking the fairly mixed customer demand and the fact that we sold the southern African mines actually is not bad 
It does show how easily we should be able to bounce back over num percent again he added saying We continue to feel very relaxed about our general view that we would average num percent profit margins over the cycle 
We ve always taken the view that we are the sort of company that s quite capable of working in difficult circumstances we re rather used to it 
And we feel very confident that we re doing all the right things Hope said 
When the profit figures will bounce back up again is just a function of markets recovering just a fraction he added 
Commenting on the continued struggle to get control of German piston maker Kolbenschmidt which has been hampered by regulatory obstacles Hope said TN s confidence continues to improve that it may eventually be able to proceed

Our trend growth rate of five percent in real terms is pretty solid Tsang told a news conference after meeting New Zealand Finance Minister Bill Birch 
There will be fluctuations in individual years but it wo nt be a big margin he said 
He said inflation was under control and the Hong Kong dollar was rock solid 
Its link to the US dollar had proved an engine of growth for the past num years 
There s absolutely no economic or financial or political reason for us to change 
A lot of investment in Hong Kong some of which is by China is predicated on the link continuing 
Britain will hand over Hong Kong to Chinese sovereignty at midnight on June num year 
Tsang said three sets of meetings with Chinese authorities on Hong Kong s dashnum budget which will span the transition period had gone smoothly 
None of our basic precepts have been challenged 
Hong Kong will retain its own currency after the handover run its own financial and monetary policy and have control over its own foreign exchange reserves 
It will have no duty to contribute any taxes to Beijing Tsang said 
He described the condition of the property market as very good indeed 
You know we went through a little climb and a little trough over the last few years 
Because of speculation in the market we introduced certain measures but they are not draconian measures and we brought it down to earth 
Tsang said the market would continue to appreciate because property and land were scarce 
The government would put land on the market to stop rentals going through the roof but this would mean reclamation with possible environmental problems 
There will be on the whole a slightly upward climb consistent with our economic growth rate he said in reference to the property market 
Tsang the third senior figure in the government after the governor and chief secretary said his stated aim was to serve as financial secretary for two years under British rule and three years under China

HK civil servants contest ban on China panel 
HONG KONG dashnum 
Senior Hong Kong civil servants were given the goahead on Thursday to challenge a government ban on them standing for the Beijingbacked panel to choose the territory s first posthandover leader and lawmakers 
The Supreme Court ruled that a judicial hearing contesting the ban would be heard on September num three days before the nomination period for the Selection Committee closes 
The government maintains the ban announced earlier this month is necessary to avoid a possible conflict of interest because civil servants are involved in determining government policy 
Civil servants argue the ban stymies their political rights 
The 400strong Selection Committee will select Hong Kong s future chief executive to replace the British governor and a provisional legislature to take over from the elected chamber which Beijing plans to dissolve 
Hong Kong a British colony for more than num years will be handed back to China at midnight on June num next year 
China intends to dismantle the territory s first fullyelected legislature because it opposes Britain s recent electoral reforms and install an interim appointed chamber a decision that has generated considerable controversy 
The judicial review sought by directorategrade bureaucrats will apply to only about num of the approximately num civil servants affected 
Police unions are not contesting the ban which affects all num officers and nor are the very top tier of Hong Kong s mandarin class the policy secretaries

Algeria faults Britain over Islamists gathering

Algeria fighting a vicious war against Moslem fundamentalist guerrillas attacked Britain on Wednesday for allowing Islamist groups to meet in London 
The Islamist gathering due to be held in London on September num has triggered concern and anger in several other Arab countries like Egypt which is also fighting armed Moslem fundamentalists 
British Jewish groups have also voiced protest because they said Palestinian Islamist Hamas as well as the banned Algerian Islamic Salvation Front FIS are among those radical Islamists attending the conference 
A foreign ministry spokesman said in a statement read on Algerian television that Algeria has received with concern the information over a meeting of terrorist groups working against the interests of the Arab and Islamic world 
Algeria expresses its sharp rejection of a meeting putting together masterminds and ideologists and financers of terrorism the spokesman said adding the Algerian government has asked the British embassy in Algiers for clarifications 
The Algerian ambassador in London has also asked for clarification from the Foreign Office over the meeting of Islamist groups 
Algeria said they are clearly working to undermine the stability of Arab countries 
British Foreign Secretary Malcolm Rifkind said on Tuesday from Pakistan his government would only take action against the planned Islamists gathering in London if British law was broken 
People who wish to hold conferences of course do nt need to seek permission from the government in Britain he said 
An estimated num people including more than num foreigners have been killed in Algeria s violence pitting Moslem rebels against government forces since early year when authorities in Algeria cancelled a general election in which FIS had taken a commanding lead

Wall Street ponders Rubin s role if Clinton wins 
Donna Sells 
NEW YORK 
The outcome of the November elections emerged as a hot topic on Wall Street this week as financial pundits debated whether Robert Rubin might forgo a second term as Treasury secretary if President Clinton is reelected 
Concern centred on the currency markets since Rubin s tour de force has been his unflagging support of the dollar 
Speculation that Rubin might not stay in his post grew after he sidestepped questions about any future Cabinet post during television interviews at the Democratic convention in Chicago this week 
Should Rubin leave Wall Street would worry that he might take his strongdollar policy with him 
Rubin s predecessor at the Treasury Lloyd Bentsen was viewed with suspicion by some in the financial markets who thought he had tried to push down the dollar to gain an edge in trade negotiations with Japan 
Obviously under the Clinton administration we ve seen two distinctively different dollar policies said Chris Widness an international economist at Chase Securities Inc Under Rubin the US has certainly looked for a strong dollar 
That strategy backed up by timely instances of joint central bank intervention helped the dollar battle back from postSecond World War lows of num German marks on March num year and num Japanese yen on April num year 
Currently the dollar stands at about num marks and num yen 
Rubin was widely hailed as the architect of the dollar s comeback using skills and expertise gained in num years on Wall Street part of which were spent as cochairman of Goldman Sachs and Co 
Inc 
Rubin has done a fine job in that position said Michael Faust a portfolio manager at Bailard Biehl and Kaiser which manages just under num billion in global stocks and bonds 
Anyone who would come in there to replace him would have awfully big shoes to fill 
Fear that a new Treasury secretary might favour a return to Bentsenera policy could spell trouble for financial markets 
Some overseas investors might shy away from buying US stocks and bonds or even sell them when the dollar is weakening 
As for US Treasury securities Widness explained that Alan Greenspan s reappointment as chairman of the Federal Reserve and the outlook for the federal budget were more important than whether Rubin continues at the Treasury 
Although if we did get someone that was seen as looking for a dollar depreciation it would probably hurt capital flows to the United States said Widness adding that could hurt US stocks and to a lesser degree bonds 
Still markets may have little to fear from any Rubin successor because the firm dollar policy has yielded positive results 
If that is true then any new Treasury chief would need to be as effective as Rubin in convincing markets that the White House does indeed want a strong currency 
If he left the first question people would ask the next guy is What s your view on the dollar 
said Michael Perelstein portfolio manager of MainStay International Funds 
And all I can say as a piece of advice is that they d better say exactly the same thing as Rubin if not stronger Perelstein said 
Otherwise you get selling out of Tokyo and Frankfurt again

NEW YORK dashnum 
Andre Agassi escaped disaster on Thursday but Wimbledon finalist MaliVai Washington and Marcelo Rios were not so fortunate on a night of upsets at the US Open 
The 11thseeded Washington fell short of reprising his Wimbledon miracle comeback as he lost to redhot wildcard Alex OBrien dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum in a two hour num minute struggle on the Stadium court 
Next door on the grandstand 10th seed Rios lost to another player with a Wimbledon connection bad boy Jeff Tarango 
The temperamental lefthander defeated the Chilean dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum 
The day programme went smoothly although sixthseeded former champion Agassi had to wriggle out of a dangerous dashnum dashnum hole winning num of the last num games against India s Leander Paes 
But the night belonged to the upstarts 
Washington who climbed back from a dashnum deficit two sets down in the third set against Todd Martin in the Wimbledon semifinals looked poised for another sensational comeback 
OBrien a winner two weeks ago in New Haven for his first pro title served for the match at dashnum in the third set before Washington came charging back 
I just kept saying to myself keep giving yourself the best chance to win keep battling maybe something will happen said the 26yearold OBrien ranked 65th 
I kept my composure and I was proud of myself for that usually I would have folded up the tent and gone home 
The hardserving OBrien a former US collegiate national champion fired up num aces to ultimately subdue the neversaydie Washington 
The fifth set stayed on serve until the sixth game when Washington after saving one break point with a forehand winner down the line netted a backhand to give OBrien a dashnum lead 
The Texan blasted in two aces to hold serve at dashnum and then converted his eighth match point for victory when Washington found the net with another backhand from dashnum 
You just kind of keep fighting and you keep trying to make him play a little bit 
I think he got a little tight at a couple of moments said Washington 
But I think he served pretty well when he had to 
Tarango whose Wimbledon tantrum two years ago brought him a num fine and suspension from this year s tournament at the AllEngland Club argued calls and taunted fans in his lively two hour num minute tango with Rios on the grandstand 
A boisterous cheering section backed the distracted Chilean and booed the lanky American who ate up all the attention 
I m an emotional player said the 104thranked Tarango 
I think I played very well tonight very focused 
The match turned on the thirdset tiebreaker which the American won dashnum much to the dismay of the spectators 
I love the crowd if they boo me every day 
It fires me up makes me play my best tennis Tarango said 
I played some of my best tennis in college when fraternities were throwing beer on me 
If tennis was like that every day I think everybody wold be having a lot more fun 
Rios did not appreciate Tarango s antics 
He s always complaining too much said Rios 
But I think it s not that 
I think I played really bad 
It was tough to play at night 
Balls were going really fast 
I lost too many points that I never lose 
I did nt play my tennis 
I do nt see the ball like I see during the day 
I play an American so that s why I play at night 
I did nt feel good on the court 
At the end of the match Tarango blew sarcastic kisses to the crowd then jiggled his body to a Rios rooting section in a jeering salute 
I support their enthusiasm Tarango said about the fans 
At the same time they re cheering blatantly against me 
After I won I figured I could give them a little razzledazzle

However December Tbonds ended below a major trendline level at 1062632 as the yield in the cash bond market set its highest monthly close since April year at num percent one analyst said 
December bonds blew through the July num low of 1070632 even though conditions were slightly oversold traders said 
The December calendar spread continued to widen also reflecting the market s fear of rising inflation

Traders said the Fed s decision to adopt a tightening bias at the July FOMC meeting has cast more focus on every piece of US economic news

Iraqi captors of Sudanese jet charged with hijack 
LONDON dashnum 
Seven Iraqis who seized a Sudanese airliner with year people aboard and forced it to fly to London were on Friday charged with hijack ending speculation that they might be offered immediate asylum in Britain 
Police said the seven men who freed all their hostages after the plane landed at Stansted airport on Tuesday and then appealed for asylum would appear in court on Saturday 
The Iraqis claimed they were ordinary people persecuted by the regime of Saddam Hussein but interior ministry officials had consistently said it was likely the seven would be charged with hijack before any plea for asylum was considered 
Under English law the maximum sentence for hijack is life imprisonment but there has been widespread speculation that the seven will receive lesser sentences and then be allowed to stay rather than being sent back to Iraq 
The hijack began on Monday when an Ammanbound plane was taken over shortly after it took off from Khartoum 
The hijackers threatened to blow it up during a refuelling stop in Cyprus unless they were taken to London 
After a search of the aircraft following the hijackers surrender police found only knives and fake explosives

The world community should not be indifferent to the fact that President Lukashenko who leads this European state of num million people is trying to establish a dictatorship with his new constitution Sharetsky said 
The new constitution calls for a twochamber parliament with a 110seat majorityelected house of representatives and a regionallyrepresented senate with a third of its members named by the president 
Lukashenko s aides shrugged off Sharetsky s charge 
If there was a dictatorship they would nt have the right to say things like this Sergei Posukhov Lukashenko s political adviser told Reuters 
The people have asked us to establish order and that s our main aim 
Lukashenko num won presidential polls in year on promises to restore order fight corruption and repair the strong links with Russia that were disrupted by the collapse of the Soviet Union 
But during his period in office he has battled against nationalist opponents trade unions and parliament and Sharetsky said the current parliament was ready to try to impeach him 
This constitution which has been prepared in secret aims to gather all power in one man s hands he said 
We should not be fooled by his quasidemocratic rhetoric and his methods like this referendum 
Lukashenko signed a pact with Moscow in April to create a strong economic and political union which he believes could grow into a federation 
But nationalist groups scared by the prospect of renewed Moscow domination and Russia s backing for Lukashenko protested against the deal 
Lukashenko responded by cracking down on the nationalist opposition and jailing nearly year people for taking part in demonstrations against the pact

Twilight zone for Wall Street as political race heats up 
Pierre Belec 
NEW YORK dashnum 
For Wall Street this is the season to be cautious as the presidential contest puts the stock market in the twilight zone 
President Clinton Bob Dole and Ross Perot are hitting the road now that the partying is over and people who have billions of dollars invested in stocks were bracing for political promises that could have an impact on their wealth 
Analysts believe that the candidates will add to the market s list of uncertainties which already includes the question of whether the Federal Reserve will raise interest rates to cool economic growth 
They say the politicians will need to promote legislation that helps the economy without scaring the socks off financial markets 
The worst thing that could happen for financial markets is that if Clinton and Dole start to trade shots in the middle of the ring with oneupmanship said Hugh Johnson chief investment officer at First Albany Corp That s when Wall Street will need to worry 
He said that the bond market would be the first to react if the bidding intensifies and stocks would quickly drop as interest rates rise 
I do nt think it would imply the collapse of the stock market unless the rise in rates touches off a dynamic within the market which would include selling by portfolio managers redemptions by individuals of mutual funds that would in turn pressure the portfolio managers to sell even more stock 
This week the market weighed Dole s proposal to lower federal income taxes by num percent across the board a package that carries a price tag of num billion 
Clinton proposes an num billion reelection agenda that would spare most homesellers from capital gains taxes and give employers tax incentives to hire people off the welfare rolls 
Clinton claims Dole s plan would increase the deficit while the White House said some corporate taxes would be raised to offset the cost of the president s plan 
The experts said there are some unusual risks for the market from this year s political season because the rush to promise tax cuts to win votes could upset Wall Street s expectations that Washington will balance the budget 
The stock market will have to edit the promises and then do a probability study on those edited promises said John Geraghty at the consulting firm North American Equity Services 
During the past four presidential elections the candidate that has favoured tax cuts has won 
Ronald Reagan s tax cut won him a second fouryear term in the White House in year while Democrat Walter Mondale who promised higher taxes lost 
George Bush became president in year on his nonewtax campaign and Clinton won in year with a promise to fatten workers paychecks 
The trick they said will be for the candidates to continue to convince Wall Street that the Treasury s 30year bond the most closelywatched interest rate will fall to between num percent and num percent by the end of the decade 
Johnson said that longterm interest rates have already been spooked by the election 
The longterm bond jumped this week to num percent after starting the year at num percent 
The surge of buying in stocks during the last two years has come amid an environment of low interest rates which has boosted corporate profits 
But the market stalled this summer after the Dow Jones industrial average set a record high of 577800 points on May num 
The market does nt seem to be able to make new highs and it has been back and forth in a fairly horizontal mode which looks like a holding pattern said Geraghty 
He said the market reflects the political uncertainty now that Dole has sharply narrowed the gap with Clinton in the polls 
Geraghty said that the one thing that could completely turn the election around are new findings in the Whitewater scandal that would damage the Clintons 
Stocks are on a delicate edge because if something happens that looks like it could upset the presidency it could throw the political and to some extent the economic process into chaos Geraghty said 
Right now Wall Street is pondering the candidates 
We have an election where there are so many unknown variables that most people will probably want to hold fire and even take the chance that they will have to pay higher prices for stocks after the November election than take the risk that a shock to the system will hurt the stock market Geraghty said

Brisk economic reports rattle markets anew 
Glenn Somerville 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
Factory orders rose in July and manufacturing surged in the Midwest in August reports said Friday sparking worries about inflation that battered financial markets for a second straight day 
The Commerce Department said orders for manufactured goods climbed num percent in July to a seasonally adjusted num billion nearly twice the increase that had been expected 
Shipments of everything from new cars to food items rose as did order backlogs in a sign that the strength in the industrial sector would continue in coming months 
A separate report from Chicago area purchasing managers underlined the strength in manufacturing as the group s barometer of manufacturing in the region jumped to num in August from num in July 
A reading above num indicates growth in manufacturing 
While production and orders rose at Midwest area businesses the prices they paid for goods used in manufacturing remained well in check 
Analysts said the reports implied the economy was not slowing down in the third quarter after a burst of growth in the spring and that the lull in late June and July was more temporary than Federal Reserve policymakers had wanted 
It appears that August is showing an economy again reversing course and is not moving onto a significantly slower track at this point said economist Lynn Reaser of Barnett Banks Inc in Jacksonville Fla 
The reports fanned worries on Wall Street that the Fed the nation s central bank would raise rates next month in a bid to ward off inflation driving stock and bond prices sharply lower for a second day running 
The 30year Treasury fell almost a point raising its yield which moves in the opposite direction from the price to num percent from num percent late Thursday 
The Dow Jones industrial average fell num points to 561621 after a 6473point decline Thursday 
A third report from the Commerce Department on July personal income and spending pointed to a potential slowdown in consumer spending that some analysts said may help moderate growth in the second half 
It showed spending rose only num percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of num trillion after dropping a revised num percent in June 
Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained num percent to a rate of num trillion after a num percent jump in June 
July s slight gain in incomes was the weakest in six months since January when they were flat 
Economist Joel Naroff of First Union bank in Philadelphia said consumer spending which fuels twothirds of the nation s economy may be much slower in the third quarter than in the first half which should slow economic growth 
The FOMC Federal Open Market Committee has been forecasting a slowing in economic activity and moderating household demand will have a large impact on overall economic growth Naroff said in a written comment 
The policymaking FOMC is to meet on Sept 
num to plot interestrate strategy 
It already has adopted a bias toward raising rates to keep a lid on wage and price rises and help sustain the dashnum 2yearold economic expansion 
In an interview on the cable television network CNBC Friday Federal Reserve Governor Lawrence Lindsey said there still were mixed signals about the economy s direction 
I think that on balance it is looking a little bit on the strong side Lindsey said 
He added that with expansion as solid as it is and with unemployment so low the greater risks are clearly that we might see some overheating 
While July consumer spending rose only slightly there were ample indications that consumers remained confident 
The University of Michigan s August index of consumer sentiment made available on Friday to paying subscribers rose to num from num in July 
Reaser said strong consumer confidence coupled with relatively lean inventories were providing manufacturers with a reason to gear up production 
The economy is not going to be expanding at the num percent annual rate that we had in the second quarter but it is likely to keep expanding in the num percent range she said above the num percent to 214 percent that the Fed considers to be noninflationary 
New orders to factories were strong for durable goods like new cars and for nondurables like paper and food products 
Orders for durable goods meant to last three years or more rose a revised num percent in July after falling num percent in June 
Orders for nondurables jumped num percent following a num percent decrease in June

Mexican avocados not expected in US 
Maggie McNeil 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
US Agriculture Department officials said Friday that Mexican avocados which are restricted from entering the continental United States will not likely be entering US markets any time soon even if the controversial ban were lifted today 
The opportunity to import Mexican avocados probably wo nt become possible for another year said Paul Drazek senior trade advisor to Agriculture Secretary Dan Glickman 
We could lift the ban tomorrow but that would not mean anything immediately said Drazek 
We probably would not see avacados come in until next season next November 
The Agriculture Department proposed more than a year ago to significantly ease an 82year ban on Mexican avocados 
Under the administration s proposal the borders to the Mexican produce would be opened into num Northern and Northeastern states from November through February 
The plan has raised a storm of protest from US avocado growers who are largely concentrated in California 
California growers have charged that removing the restrictions even on a limited basis would endanger the num billion US industry if potentially harmful Mexican insects were brought into the country along with the avocados 
Mexican officials contend that there is no scientific basis for the ban and that it is illegal under international trading rules of the World Trade Organisation 
Proponents of the plan discount the worries of the US growers and say the plan has enough safeguards built into it to eliminate any significant threat to American producers 
Under the proposal only imports of exportquality avocados growing in approved orchards in Michoacan Mexico the country s main avocado area would be allowed 
Mexican growers and distributors would have to abide by strict rules established by the Mexican and US agriculture agencies 
The California Avocado Commission which has spearheaded the opposition to lifting the ban said new data the group submitted to the Agriculture Department last spring shows the department underestimated the pest problem in Mexico and have urged that the agency reopen its study of the issue 
The administration is still studying the new data and officials have said that if experts think the information is significant the agency could reopen its investigation 
But US avocado industry sources said that while they may have delayed the plan for a while they ultimately do not expect the administration to change its position 
From a commonsense view the department should reconsider this plan but due to politics they will probably go ahead with this said Tom Bellamore of the California avocado group 
Administration officials said they want to get the issue resolved as quickly as possible but said there is no timetable they are working under 
It s a very complicated issue said the Agriculture Department s Drazek 
We ll get it resolved as quickly as we can based on the best available science

US Cardinal Bernardin says has terminal cancer 
CHICAGO dashnum 
Chicago Cardinal Joseph Bernardin head of the secondlargest US Roman Catholic archdiocese said on Friday his doctors had diagnosed him as having liver cancer and he had a year or less to live 
Bernardin num underwent extensive surgery for pancreatic cancer in June year followed by months of chemotherapy which he said made him more aware of his own vulnerabilities and the need to minister to the sick 
On Wednesday examinations indicated that the cancer has returned this time in the liver 
I am told that it is terminal and that my life expectancy is one year or less a composed Bernardin told a news conference 
In num years as Chicago s archbishop he built a prayerful saintly image and was deeply involved in world church issues and publicly committed to rooting out abuses by clergy 
I have been assured that I still have some quality time left he said saying he would undergo a new form of chemotherapy but his doctors have told him there was only a slim chance of a cure and the liver cancer was inoperable 
It s not going to be easy to say goodbye to everybody 
Death does have some sad dimensions to it but I am a man of faith he said 
Death is a natural phenomenom 
He said he would serve until the end as cardinal 
Pancreatic cancer is among the most deadly forms of the disease although Bernardin s case was caught early 
Surgeons removed a cancerous kidney parts of his pancreas and stomach small intestine bile duct and surrounding tissues 
He made a rapid recovery and resumed most of his duties but then developed a deteriorating condition in his spine that caused him great pain and shortened his height by several inches 
He was scheduled to undergo back surgery next month but that was cancelled when the cancer was discovered in his liver in order to avoid delaying the start of chemotherapy 
The spare softspoken son of an Italian stonecutter took over the Chicago archdiocese the nation s secondlargest after Los Angeles with num million parishioners in year 
Ironically Bernardin who developed a progressive muchpraised programme to deal with pedophilia involving priests became the highestranking church official ever accused of sexual improprieties when a former seminary student leveled charges in year that he had been sexually abused by Bernardin during the 1970s 
Bernardin steadfastly denied the charges and the former student later recanted his tale of abuse 
Bernardin prayed with him before he died from AIDS last year 
Bernardin who became archbishop of Cincinnati in year played an increasingly prominent role in the US church as a moderate voice of compromise among liberals and conservatives in the ranks of the bishops 
This month he announced that he would oversee a series of conferences to find common ground among American Catholics 
Previously he was instrumental in drafting church policy on war peace and nuclear arms and for seven years he headed the bishops antiabortion policy committee espousing a policy describing human life as a seamless garment

Boatmen s deal could spark more mergers

CHICAGO dashnum 
The num billion proposed acquisition of Boatmen s Bancshares Inc by NationsBank Corp could spark a flurry of other mergers involving Missouri banks which until last year were protected from outside buyers by state regulations 
NationsBank just strolled into the Midwest and bagged the biggest banking trophy in the landscape said Michael Ancell banking industry analyst at Edward D Jones Co 
Whoever wants a big market position in the Midwest has to come in and grab Mercantile or Commerce 
St Louisbased Mercantile Bancorp Inc a bank holding company with num billion in assets was seen by many analysts as the most attractive Missouri franchise in size after Boatmen s 
Kansas City Mobased Commerce Bancshares Inc with num billion in assets also could help a regional bank establish a strong presence in the lower Midwest analysts added 
It focuses more attention on Mercantile Commerce and Roosevelt said James Weber analyst at AG Edwards Sons 
Roosevelt Financial Group Inc is a num billion assetSt 
Louis based thrift 
Now the most coveted bank out there is Mercantile Weber said 
Mercantile and Commerce did not return phone calls seeking comment 
Among those seen as having an interest in buying in Missouri are Minneapolisbased First Bank System Inc and Norwest Corp Ohiobased KeyCorp and Banc One Corp and First Chicago NBD Corp in Illinois 
Representatives of First Bank Norwest Banc One and First Chicago said the banks do not comment on rumors of possible mergers or acquisitions 
KeyCorp contacted by phone would not comment 
With a presence in nine states and num billion in assets 
Boatmen s was the prize in Missouri where barriers to outside acquirers were brought down last year by a federal banking statute 
Boatmen s was the plum of Missouri and was the plum of the central Midwest Weber said 
Talk that the Missouri banks were seeking inflated prices from buyers was seen as a reason a deal has not occurred sooner 
But NationsBank s bid representing a premium of num percent for Boatmen s stock was large enough to get the deal done 
I think Boatmen s was shopping itself and everybody knew if you wanted to be the winning buyer here you had to make the bid nobody would beat Ancell said 
But some analysts cautioned that other targets should not expect as large a premium 
They also questioned whether NationsBank can recoup shareholder value with such a large bid for Boatmen s 
I think initially some stocks will trade up on sympathy but the wild premium NationsBank put on this deal here I do nt see a lot of other deals being done at this premium said Michael Durante analyst at McDonald Co

Practices of the Israeli government especially its settlement activities came to confirm that dealing with this government inflicts the biggest harm on the Arab cause staterun Damascus Radio said in a commentary 
When this government insists on stabbing the peace process and tearing it apart this means that it is preparing for war the radio said 
Palestinian President Yasser Arafat described this week the decision to expand settlements in the West Bank as a declaration of war 
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza observed a strike on Thursday to protest against the Israeli move 
The radio urged Arabs to unify their ranks to thwart the policies of the rightwing Israeli government 
Israel could not confront a united Arab stand or usurp their rights because the Arab rights could be regained when they achieve unity and solidarity Damascus radio said 
It welcomed the international criticism of Israel s settlement policies but called for practical steps to force the Israeli government to abandon this policy 
It is important to translate the criticism into pressuring action to prevent Israel from undermining the big international efforts aimed at making the peace process achieve success the radio said

Consumer spending incomes edge up in July 
Glenn Somerville 
WASHINGTON dashnum 
Consumer spending barely edged up in July the Commerce Department said Friday as income growth slowed abruptly to the weakest pace in six months 
Spending rose num percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of num trillion after dropping a revised num percent in June 
Incomes from wages salaries and all other sources gained num percent to a rate of num trillion after a num percent jump in June 
Department officials said July s slight gain in incomes was the weakest for any month since January when they were flat 
Wages and salaries came under pressure in July as a shorter average workweek and lower hourly earnings cut into paychecks 
The department said wages and salaries decreased by num billion in July after climbing num billion in June 
In July average weekly hours and average hourly earnings declined more than offsetting the effect of an increase in employment Commerce said 
But more money went into savings accounts as savings held at num cents out of each dollar earned in both June and July 
That was the highest savings rate since October last year when num cents out of each dollar earned was being saved 
The generally lackluster report on spending and incomes in July had been expected 
At the same time the department said in a separate report that new orders received by US factories climbed strongly in July with widespread gains across most major categories 
Orders increased num percent to a seasonally adjusted num billion significantly stronger than the num percent rise forecast by Wall Street economists 
That followed a revised num percent decline in June orders 
Commerce said previously that spending at retail stores was up only num percent in July partly because of softer sales of new cars and light trucks 
In addition the Labour Department s July employment report had foreshadowed the muted income growth 
It showed average hourly earnings fell in July by num percent to num and the average workweek shortened to num hours from num in June 
Gains in personal income which includes wages and salaries as well as income from sources such as dividends interest and businesses are essential for funding consumer purchases which fuel twothirds of national economic activity 
Spending on all types of durable goods which includes cars fell to an annual rate of num billion in July from num billion in June 
But spending on nondurable products increased moderately to a rate of num trillion from num trillion in June while spending for services was up to num trillion in July from num trillion

Analysts said Wall Street had grown accustomed to a moderate Republican in the form of Democratic President Clinton

Pirelli cables look to tap Chinese growth 
David Jones 
MILAN dashnum 
Italian tyre and cables giant Pirelli on Friday announced its longawaited move into China with a cables joint venture set to capitalise on the rapidlygrowing Chinese telecommunications market 
Pirelli is linking with Hong Kongbased group CITIC Pacific in a venture to be called the Wuxi Tong Ling Company Ltd which will operate in partnership with a local industrial company at its existing factory in Wuxi Jiangsu province Shanghai 
The partners will invest around num million in the existing copper cable plant at Wuxi to update technology and include optic fibre production with annual turnover expected to reach num million within the next few years 
The move marks a further move by Pirelli s cables division to expand in the fastgrowing Far Eastern developing markets with the group already present in Indonesia India and Malaysia 
This is really positive news for Pirelli and I expect that it will produce one of the best halfyear results in late September compared to other industrial Italian companies said analyst Paula Buratti at Indosuez 
She emphasised that the move was positive because Pirelli will have management control of the Chinese venture and it also showed another example of Pirelli exporting its technical knowhow to developing markets 
Pirelli shares reacted favourable even though talks had been underway for some time and news about a venture had been widely expected 
The shares rose num percent to num lire by num GMT in an easier Milan stock market 
This will be Pirelli s first industrial involvement in a Chinese market where demand for telecommunication networks is expected to grow to dashnum million new lines between year and year doubling demand for optical cables 
China s second largest telecoms operator Unicom already has a mandate from the central government to establish num million new phone lines by the year year which will necessitate new trunk line systems and local distribution networks 
The starting of this production base in China has for our group an undoubted strategic value representing an important enhancement of our presence in Asia said Pirelli SpA chairman and chief executive officer Marco Tonchetti Provera 
Pirelli Cables has global sales of over num billion and has become a large supplier of optic cables and systems to major telecoms carriers in the US Europe and the Far East 
CITIC Pacific is a major Hong Konglisted company focusing on infrastruture trading distribution and property with num percent of its year profits coming from telecoms 
It has investments in several industrial joint ventures in China

Dutch bond futures revival delayed EOE 
AMSTERDAM dashnum 
A broad attempt to spur activity in Dutch bond futures has been delayed to give participants a chance to become familiar with the trading system the European Options Exchange EOE said on Friday 
Marketmaking in the rarelytraded FTO contract was expected to begin today but an EOE spokesman said the num banks and brokers involved in the initiative needed time to get accustomed to changes in the electronic trading system 
It s not ready yet 
We found it wise to take some time between the commitment to start and the actual start EOE spokesman Lex van Drooge told Reuters 
He said no date had been fixed yet for the start of price making in the 10year contract but the EOE had agreed to speak again to the participants in one to two weeks 
Investors in Dutch bonds currently use German bond futures to hedge their portfolios because the FTO contract is so illiquid 
A limited attempt to reinvigorate the contract two years ago failed

OSCE defends record over Chechnya peace mission 
BONN dashnum 
The head of an international mediating mission defended its record on Friday in the face of criticism by proMoscow leaders in breakway Chechnya and insisted it was doing its best to bring peace to the region 
Flavio Cotti the chairman of the Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe OSCE told German radio the Viennabased body viewed the conflict in Chechnya as an internal Russian problem 
The OSCE is completely involved 
But one must not forget that the OSCE only has limited powers there said Cotti who is also the Swiss foreign minister 
Our mission in Chechnya has done all it can within the given limitations 
ProMoscow leaders in Chechnya have criticised Tim Guldimann the Swiss diplomat who heads the OSCE Chechnya mission saying he was biased toward Zelimkhan Yandarbiyev president of the selfdeclared separatist government 
Russian peacemaker Alexander Lebed and Chechen separatist military leader Aslan Maskhadov started a new round of peace talks on Friday just outside the rebel region 
Cotti said Chechnya must remain part of Russia but the solution to the conflict would be to accord the region maximum autonomy within Russia s borders 
There is no doubt that Chechnya according to OSCE principles belongs to a state called Russia he said pointing out that Russia was an OSCE member and it was not the organisation s policy to challenge members sovereignty 
He added that the OSCE was the only international body which has been allowed into the Chechnya to monitor the human rights situation there but that its means were restricted by the fact that the conflict was a internal issue 
We have a small concept the details of which have yet to be worked out 
Chechnya must be accorded the maximum autonomy possible within the framework of Russian integrity said Cotti

Sombre mood on Arctic island after plane crash 
Rolf Soderlind 
LONGYEAR Norway dashnum 
The windblown chilly streets of this tiny Arctic town are all but deserted and flags are flying at halfmast beneath a brooding clouded sky 
Longyear is a town in mourning a closeknit community that has been shattered 
Disaster struck on Thursday when a Russian airliner bringing coal miners to work crashed as it came in to land at the airport killing all num people on board 
It s a sight I will never forget 
I will remember it for the rest of my life said Stig Onarheim 
He was one of a handful of rescuers who raced to the scene of the crash in a helicopter on Thursday hoping in vain to find survivors 
The plane smashed into a snowcapped mountain on the Arctic island of Spitzbergen on Thursday just east of Longyear 
Imagine a big plane with a lot of luggage and people on board 
Think of all that mixed together with twisted wrecked parts on the slope Onarheim num told Reuters 
Police and local officials have sealed off the crash site protecting it from intrusive reporters and from the polar bears that roam freely across the icy expanses 
The dead were all Russians and Ukrainians coming to work in the mining towns of Barentsburg and Pyramiden 
Longyear is a Norwegian settlement of just over num people but it also feels the loss keenly 
I have trouble finding the words to express my grief 
It s a tragedy for everyone 
We know many of the people who live in Barentsburg some of them could have been on the plane said Johan Sletten num 
Sletten a caretaker who has lived on the island for num years said the Norwegian and Russian communities visit frequently competing at soccer in the summer and with snowscooter races in the winter 
Teenage shop assistant Heidi Groenstein was blunter 
I m glad it was not a Norwegian plane she said 
Just think of it a mining village where so many workers die 
They must be having a tough time of it now 
Barentsburg just a few hours ride by snowscooter or num minutes by helicopter from Longyear has asked to be left alone with its grief and told reporters to stay away 
Around num Russian and Ukrainian miners were waiting in Longyear to fly home on the plane that crashed 
They were given shelter in the town s church overnight and ate a sombre breakfast before getting on a bus for the airport 
Another plane had been sent from Moscow to pick them up 
At this time of year the only colour in Longyear comes from the brightlypainted wooden houses 
Everything else is muddy the waters of the fjord leaden 
Winter is in the air 
Barentsburg is an even grimmer place a rundown testament to the hardships of the new Russia 
Spitzbergen lies some num miles num km off the northern tip of Norway and endures one of the most extreme climates on the planet 
Inhabited by fewer than num people in total it sees the sun for num hours a day during summer and is plunged into roundtheclock darkness in the winter months 
The terrain is mountainous the only roads are dirt tracks 
Norway rules the island group under the terms of a 1920s international treaty which gave many other nations the right to establish setttlements and exploit the coal that is still mined there 
Only Russia has chosen to do so

SOCCER REAL SCRAPE dashnum DRAW IN SCRAPPY OPENING MATCH 
LA CORUNA Spain dashnum 
A late goal by newlysigned defender Roberto Carlos saved the blushes of Real Madrid coach Fabio Capello and his multibillion peseta lineup in the opening game of the Spanish championship on Saturday 
The Brazilian s 79thminute effort was enough to earn Real a point from a scrappy dashnum draw at fellow title contenders Deportivo Coruna 
Deportivo started strongly taking the lead midway through the first half when former Auxerre playmaker Corentine Martins headed home a corner after a flickon by Brazilianborn Spanish international midfielder Donato 
Real looked to be in deep trouble shortly after the break when Luis Milla was sent off for committing two bookable offences in as many minutes 
But Deportivo were unable to capitalise on their numerical advantage and were themselves reduced to ten men when Armando Alvarez was sent off num minutes from time 
Shortly afterwards Roberto Carlos found space in the home defence and equalised for Real with a shot that was deflected past despairing Deportivo keeper Jacques Songoo 
In a frantic final five minutes there were chances at both ends and Donato who had earlier been booked was sent off for protesting about the incursion of Real players at a free kick 
Before the match Deportivo chairman Augusto Lendoiro said he would ignore a FIFA decision banning Brazilian midfielder Mauro Silva from playing in the match for failing to join his national side s tour of Europe 
In the event coach John Toshack decided not to use Silva who had claimed he did not join the Brazil squad because he had lost his passport

RUGBY UNION SPRINGBOKS FINALLY BREAK ALL BLACK SPELL 
Andy Colquhoun 
JOHANNESBURG dashnum 
South Africa managed to avoid a fifth successive defeat in year at the hands of the All Blacks with an emphatic dashnum victory in front of an ecstatic Ellis Park crowd on Saturday 
They scored three tries in recording their highest total against New Zealand salvaging some pride in a season in which the world champions have lost five out of eight tests 
It also ended a run of nine successive victories this year for New Zealand but arrived too late to prevent a dashnum series defeat and an historic first All Black series triumph on South African soil 
Springbok scrumhalf Joost van der Westhuizen was his side s inspiration scoring their opening try and making the third for flanker Andre Venter from a quickly taken penalty to give his side a dashnum lead after num minutes 
Fullback Andre Joubert scored the other scorching in from num metres at the start of the second half to add to his three longrange penalties 
The All Blacks salvaged some pride by scoring two tries from centre Walter Little and scrumhalf Justin Marshall in the final five minutes to close a gap which at one point stood at num points 
But they generally endured an offday highlighted by recalled flyhalf Andrew Mehrtens who missed five out of eight kicks at goal 
Recalled flyhalf Henry Honiball kicked the Springboks into a dashnum lead after num minutes only to see Andrew Mehrtens launch a penalty from eight metres inside his own half to narrow the gap 
Mehrtens missed three further penalties and a conversion in the first num minutes which could have put his side ahead but it was the Springboks who looked the more dangerous 
Their promise was realised when Joubert made a 40metre break in the 25th minute and although winger Pieter Hendriks appeared to knock on Joubert s reverse pass Welsh referee Derek Bevan allowed Van der Westhuizen to pick up and score under the posts 
Honiball converted and Joubert kicked a penalty before All Black hooker Sean Fitzpatrick scored a try from close range on the stroke of halftime to narrow the lead to dashnum and hint at a comeback 
Instead Joubert kicked another long penalty and then raced around the outside of the defence to score the Springboks second try 
A quick penalty from Van der Westhuizen five metres from the All Black line set up the third try for Venter five minutes later and when Joubert kicked his third penalty the Springboks held an unassailable dashnum lead going into the last quarter 
When the All Blacks did break through it was too late 
Centre Walter Little followed up Mehrtens kick to score under the posts and scrumhalf Justin Marshall forced himself over from a ruck close to the line in injurytime to give them some consolation

SQUASH HILL BRANDS WORLD CHAMPION JANSHER A CHEAT 
HONG KONG dashnum 
Controversial Australian Anthony Hill called Jansher Khan a cheat during his acrimonious defeat by the world number one in the Hong Kong Open semifinals on Saturday 
The match boiled over when Hill made to walk off court after what he claimed was a gamewinning point in the third 
When the referee called Jansher s return good and the decision was accepted by the player Hill shrieked at the Pakistani You cheat 
He was standing right there and knew the shot was down so I called him a cheat said Hill whose squash career has been blighted by fines and suspensions for unacceptable behaviour 
He knew it was down and accepted what I called him because of that 
Hill won the game on the next point and said later that Jansher was generally honest on court but played by the referee s decision 
The Australian had upset Jansher s rhythm with his mixture of gamesmanship and fluent strokemaking but eventually succumbed dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum 
I changed my strategy against him today and had him rattled he added 
He is not as fit as he used to be be but was too good for me in the end 
I shook him a bit but he will come out next time and be a better player for it that s Jansher 
Jansher said that he was disturbed to be called a cheat 
What he did was bad for squash bad for the crowd and bad for the sponsors 
We are trying to build up squash like tennis and players should not say things like that 
I think the Professional Squash Association should look into this matter and deal with it properly 
I am not calling for him to be banned but they have to take some action

Eyles who defeated Jansher in the semifinals of the Portuguese Open in year said that he would like to win for the good of the game

Richard Finn 
NEW YORK dashnum 
This year s Fed Cup finalists defending champion Spain and the United States will hit the road to open the year women s international team competition based on the draw conducted Saturday at the US Open 
Spain travels to Belgium while the US team heads to the Netherlands for firstround matches March dashnum 
The other two firstround ties will pit hosts Germany against the Czech Republic and visiting France against Japan 
The semifinals are July dashnum and the final September dashnum num 
Life on the road this year did not slow the Americans who will try to avenge their dashnum defeat in the final last year when they host Spain on September dashnum in Atlantic City 
Last year we stood on the court after we had lost and we put out hands together and made it our committment to bring back the Cup US captain Billie Jean King said at the draw 
That is our sole goal 
The United States edged Austria in Salzburg dashnum in the opening round in April and then blanked Japan dashnum in Nagoya last month in the semifinals 
The victory against Japan marked the Fed Cup debut of Monica Seles who became a naturalised US citizen in year 
Seles easily won both her singles matches and King is counting on the coworld number one to lead the team again 
I told Monica we need her if we want to win King said 
Seles s sore left shoulder and a wrist injury to Fed Cup veteran Mary Joe Fernandez have forced King to take a wait and see attitude regarding her squad for the bestoffive match 
Fernandez was forced to withdraw from the US Open

Richard Finn 
NEW YORK dashnum 
Refusing to go quietly in the night Stefan Edberg extended his stay at his 14th and last US Open when Bernd Karbacher trailing and hurting quit in the fourth set of their secondround match Friday 
The 30yearold Edberg a former twotime Open champion had wrestled control of the match away from Karbacher when the German hampered by a left hamstring injury decided he could nt continue under the stadium lights at the National Tennis Centre 
A win is a win 
I ll take it Edberg who has announced that this will be his last Grand Slam event said of the dashnum dashnum dashnum dashnum victory 
Ironically Karbacher two years ago ended Ivan Lendl s Grand Slam career here when the former champion had to retire in the middle of their firstround match 
After seeing the trainer come out early in the third set Edberg was not surprised by Karbacher s decision not to go on 
I knew he had problems with something Edberg said 
I really was nt surprised 
Edberg had his own problems early in the match as the Swede battled to acclimate himself to the nighttime conditions while Karbacher was ripping passing shots and blasting serves past him 
I did nt really feel good to begin with I had problems finding the timing on the ball seeing the ball said Edberg who upset Wimbledon champion and fifthseeded Richard Krajicek in the first round 
This was one of these matches where I did nt play up to my standard 
I had to fight hard 
Edberg s tenacity paid off in the second set 
Edberg lost his own serve twice but he rallied for three breaks of his own the last to wrap up the set 
That s where the match sort of changed said Edberg 
I think once I got that second set I felt a lot better about my game 
Edberg is starting to feel pretty good about postponing his swan song a lot longer 
It does nt look all that bad Edberg said of his path through the draw starting next with a match against Krajicek s Dutch countryman Paul Haarhuis 
However the year and year champion is not ready to start making plans to be in next week s final 
I m always being realistic said Edberg 
Like I said many times I think it s a very little chance but nothing is impossible 
If I play great tennis that could take me a long way 
A lot of things can happen like tonight

Euro num absentee Nicolas Ouedec and Youri Djorkaeff scored the goals as year World Cup hosts France beat Mexico dashnum in a friendly international on Saturday 
The victory extended to num matches France s unbeaten run under coach Aime Jacquet their Euro num semifinal elimination having come in a penalty shootout but was marred by the sendingoff of Chelsea central defender Franck Leboeuf 
Leboeuf was dismissed two minutes from time for a second bookable offence fouling Mexican substitute Ricardo Pelaez who minutes earlier had also been shown the yellow card for pushing the Chelsea defender in the back 
Both goals came early in the second half after France had surprised the Mexicans with three halftime substitutions 
After a sterile first half France injected more sting in midfield with the introduction of Juventus s Zinedine Zidane 
This allowed Djorkaeff to play further up and his cross from the right fell for Ouedec who has joined Espanyol of Barcelona from Nantes since missing the European championship finals through injury to score after a mistake by midfielder Joaquin del Olmo 
Within four minutes Ouedec was returning the compliment for Djorkaeff playing a onetwo with the Internazionale Milan forward down the middle to set him up for a cross shot past diving goalkeeper Osvaldo Sanchez

Paper says Thatcher s office consulted astrologer 
LONDON dashnum 
A British newspaper said Margaret Thatcher was so shaken by an IRA attempt on her life when she was prime minister in year that an astrologer was asked to warn her against future threats 
The Sunday Telegraph quoted Majorie Orr as saying she did a horoscope chart for Thatcher a Libran after she narrowly escaped death in the Irish guerrilla bombing of a hotel during the Conservative Party conference more than a decade ago 
Orr said Thatcher s press secretary Bernard Ingram asked her to telephone if she saw any threatening indications in the future 
Bernard Ingham told me that if I ever heard anything that indicated danger I was to let him know Orr said 
Orr said she never had to telephone 
She added that the horoscope was purely for security purposes and she was never consulted about political moves 
Ingram was quoted as telling the newspaper he thought astrology was a load of rubbish and that he could not recall asking Orr to keep a watch on Thatcher s stars 
Thatcher dubbed the Iron Lady for her driven forceful personality was never known to have an interest in the occult and in fact has a university degree in chemistry 
Former US president Ronald Reagan s wife Nancy admitted in her biography My Turn that she regularly consulted an astrologer to help her plan her husband s schedule

S African Afrikaners still seek own territory 
CAPE TOWN dashnum 
South African rightwing Afrikaners on Saturday revived their campaign for a form of selfrule identifying a sparselypopulated area in Northern Cape province as the best place for a home of their own 
Constand Viljoen leader of the Freedom Front party told a news conference in Pretoria selfdetermination for Afrikaners could begin at local government level 
Certain powers can be delegated from the provincial level towards the subregions he said 
We think that the Afrikaner model within this new multi ethnic society of South Africa will have to develop experimentally with world thinking in this regard 
Viljoen broke with other rightwing whites in year by taking part in the country s first allrace elections in April of that year saying the only way to attain selfdetermination was by cooperating with President Nelson Mandela s majority African National Congress 
Some rightwingers demanded sovereignty in their own territory in the runup to the elections saying the alternative was war 
Their threats came to nothing 
Viljoen has hailed clauses in South Africa s new constitution as making possible a form of selfrule for the Afrikaners descendants of the country s Dutch German and French settlers 
According to state television Viljoen told the news conference the selfrule model should be introduced in parts of the Northern Cape provinces where a majority of people whites and mixedrace Coloureds speak Afrikaans

Chechens exuberant but cautious on peace deal 
Liutauras Stremaitis 
URUSMARTAN Russia dashnum 
Crowds of proindependence Chechens greeted a newlysigned peace deal by singing dancing and firing guns in the air on Saturday but the celebrations held a trace of uncertainty 
More than a thousand women children and men gathered in a field to the north of the town of UrusMartan on Saturday to wait for a column of rebels to withdraw from the capital Grozny about num km num miles away 
The men fired weapons into the air as groups of women danced 
Adults in the crowd carried posters of former Chechen leader Dzhokhar Dudayev who declared independence in year and children carrying photographs of him called Troops out 

Russian military officials have expressed fears that the rebels and their supporters will see the deal signed by Russian peace envoy Alexander Lebed in the early hours of Saturday as a military victory for the separatists 
It involves the withdrawal of Russian troops sent to Chechnya in December year to crush the separatists and a postponement of the issue at the heart of the conflict the status of the mainlyMoslem North Caucasus region 
But the people in the crowd on Saturday who had turned out in support of the rebels did not seem sure that the war was over 
We hope for the best that it really has ended so we can live in peace 
It s our only dream said a 30yearold woman Mubatik Dagayeva 
Aiza Dudayeva with her 10yearold son beside her shared the guarded optimism 
We really want the war to end we hope and believe that our sons and brothers will win said Dudayeva adding that she was from UrusMartan 
UrusMartan is a traditionally antiseparatist pocket in Chechnya and Moscowbacked leader Doku Zavgayev who has been sidelined in the peace deal has warned that it and places like it could become centres of civil war if Russian troops leave 
But on Saturday the people gathered just outside the town seemed to be united in favour of the separatists 
Two columns of rebels appeared in jeeps and cars firing their guns in the air as the crowd rushed towards them 
Mouldi Mamatuyev in his late num s dressed in black and carrying a machine gun was welcomed by his mother and sister 
Two sons have come back said his mother Nurbika Mamatuyeva 
It s the end 
We believe in God 
Mamatuyev joked that his sister Lisa was a rebel too and she responded by grabbing hold of his gun and shouting the Chechen war cry Allahu Akhbar God is Greatest and Freedom for Chechnya 

The fighter sitting next to a man dressed in green and carrying a grenadelauncher said that the strict Islamic law adopted by the rebels during the conflict was now needed to impose peace 
The war has ended if everything works out if there is law there will be power 
Only Sheriat Islamic law can end the war

China said to fear dissidents more than criminals 
MANILA dashnum 
The detention of veteran dissident Wang Donghai showed China s determination to crush any vestige of dissent during the current profound transitions in the nation s leadership a human rights activist said on Saturday 
Xiao Qiang executive director of the New Yorkbased group Human Rights in China said Wang s arrest on Friday appeared to be part of the national Strike Hard campaign that has imprisoned thousands and sent hundreds to their death 
Although supposedly aimed at criminals dozens of human rights activists have been detained in the campaign which is meant to strengthen the Communist Party s grip on power as senior leader Deng Xiaoping nears death Xiao said in an interview 
China is going through this power transition period 
The authorities are apparently extremely afraid of any political and social discontent said Xiao in Manila to attend an Amnesty International conference on human rights in China 
He said one of Wang s apparent offences was to write a public letter in May suggesting that a free press and an independent judicial system were vital if the government really meant to stamp out rampant corruption 
Xiao said crushing legitimate dissent was only making the problem worse and one day China would pay a high price 
Those issues are not going to go away by repression 
You only make things more hidden but potentially more explosive he said 
Wang was arrested in the east China city of Hangzhou by security officers who told the dissident s family he would be sent to a study class a euphemism for coercive ideological reform 
Wang num was sentenced last month to one year s reeducation by labour but was released because of illhealth 
Xiao said conditions in the labour camp were so brutal they drove another activist sentenced with Wang to attempt suicide 
Police beat Wang and his colleague Chen Longde and encouraged other camp inmates to attack them as well Xiao said

Burma s Suu Kyi says military rulers abuse law 
Deborah Charles 
RANGOON dashnum 
Burma s democracy leader Aung San Suu Kyi hit out at the government on Saturday for recent arrests and jailing of activists saying the military abused the law to try to crush the democracy movement 
The main purpose of this press conference is to make it known to the world that the authorities are misusing the law all the time in order to try to crush the democracy movement Suu Kyi told reporters at her Rangoon home 
Suu Kyi said at least num democracy supporters had been arrested since May and about num of them had been sentenced most to long prison terms 
In May the government launched a sweeping crackdown on the democracy movement detaining over num members of Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy NLD ahead of a party congress 
Most were released but several dozen remain in custody 
The Burmese government last week confirmed the recent sentencing of nine democracy activists who were arrested in the May crackdown including Suu Kyi s assistant Win Htein 
The military government which in May said it had detained the politicians to prevent anarchy said the activists were charged with attempting to destroy the peace and stability of the state 
But Suu Kyi disagreed with the methods saying officials often arrested NLD supporters in the middle of the night then did not give them the opportunity to defend themselves in trials 
When our people are tried they are tried in a very secretive way 
Their families are not told she said 
Suu Kyi who spearheads a campaign for sanctions on Burma s government was under house arrest for six years without being tried before being released in July year 
Several other leading members of the NLD have served prison terms 
The NLD party won a landslide victory in a year election but the State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC which assumed power in year after crushing prodemocracy demonstrations never recognised the poll 
This lack of rule of law is an indication that the authorities are not interested in fair play she said 
They are using a travesty of the law to try and crush our movements and to sentence our people to long terms in prison without proper trial 
Suu Kyi said once the activists were sentenced they suffered inhuman conditions and lack of rights in prison 
Almost all of the prisoners start suffering from various health problems after a couple of years in jail she said 
Some of our people have been in prison for five to six years 
Most political prisoners are held in Rangoon s Insein Prison 
Some who have been released have recounted torture methods like sleep and food deprivation and physical abuse 
If there are any more instances of death in custody it will be further proof that a prison sentence for political prisoners is sometimes almost the same as a death sentence Suu Kyi said 
Hla Than an elected member of parliament for the NLD died in early August after being at Insein for six years 
His death came five weeks after James Leander Leo Nichols a close friend of Suu Kyi and Danish honorary consul died while serving a prison term at Insein 
Suu Kyi said the government had increased its repression tactics on the democracy movement because it feared the growing popularity of the movement 
But she said she and the NLD would not stop their efforts to bring democracy to Burma even if it meant more arrests of party members or even herself 
We will carry on 
Nobody is free from arrest in Burma

Japan began the defence of their Asian Cup title with a lucky 21 win against Syria in a Group C championship match on Friday 
But China saw their luck desert them in the second match of the group crashing to a surprise 20 defeat to newcomers Uzbekistan 
China controlled most of the match and saw several chances missed until the 78th minute when Uzbek striker Igor Shkvyrin took advantage of a misdirected defensive header to lob the ball over the advancing Chinese keeper and into an empty net 
Oleg Shatskiku made sure of the win in injury time hitting an unstoppable left foot shot from just outside the area 
The former Soviet republic was playing in an Asian Cup finals tie for the first time 
Despite winning the Asian Games title two years ago Uzbekistan are in the finals as outsiders 
Two goals from defensive errors in the last six minutes allowed Japan to come from behind and collect all three points from their opening meeting against Syria 
Takuya Takagi scored the winner in the 88th minute rising to head a Hiroshige Yanagimoto cross towards the Syrian goal which goalkeeper Salem Bitar appeared to have covered but then allowed to slip into the net 
It was the second costly blunder by Syria in four minutes 
Defender Hassan Abbas rose to intercept a long ball into the area in the 84th minute but only managed to divert it into the top corner of Bitar s goal 
Nader Jokhadar had given Syria the lead with a wellstruck header in the seventh minute 
Japan then laid siege to the Syrian penalty area for most of the game but rarely breached the Syrian defence 
Bitar pulled off fine saves whenever they did 
Japan coach Shu Kamo said The Syrian own goal proved lucky for us 
The Syrians scored early and then played defensively and adopted long balls which made it hard for us

Cuttitta announced his retirement after the 1995 World Cup where he took issue with being dropped from the Italy side that faced England in the pool stages

Little has opted not to risk aggravating the knee injury which ruled him out of a large chunk of the tour and is replaced by fellow Queenslander Daniel Herbert 
Owen Finegan has recovered from the knocks he took in last weekend s test against Wales and retains his place in the backrow ahead of Daniel Manu 
The Wallabies have their sights set on a 13th successive victory to end their European tour with a 100 percent record but also want to turn on the style and provide David Campese with a fitting sendoff in his final match in Australian colours 
The Wallabies currently have no plans to make any special presentation to the 34yearold winger but a full house of 75000 spectators will still gather in the hope of witnessing one last moment of magic 
Campese will be up against a familiar foe in the shape of Barbarians captain Rob Andrew the man who kicked Australia to defeat with a lastditch dropgoal in the World Cup quarterfinal in Cape Town 
Campo has a massive following in this country and has had the public with him ever since he first played here in 1984 said Andrew also likely to be making his final Twickenham appearance 
On tour Australia have won all four tests against Italy Scotland Ireland and Wales and scored 414 points at an average of almost 35 points a game

MELBOURNE 19961206 
Australia gave Brian Lara another reason to be miserable when they beat West Indies by five wickets in the opening World Series limited overs match on Friday 
Lara disciplined for misconduct on Wednesday was dismissed for five to extend a disappointing run of form on tour 
Australia who hold a 20 lead in the fivematch test series overhauled West Indies total of 172 all out with eight balls to spare to end a run of six successive oneday defeats 
Allrounder Greg Blewett steered his side to a comfortable victory with an unbeaten 57 in 90 balls to the delight of the 42442 crowd 
Manofthe match Blewett came to the wicket with the total on 70 for two and hit three fours during an untroubled innings lasting 129 minutes 
His crucial fifthwicket partnership with fellow allrounder Stuart Law who scored 21 added 71 off 85 balls 
Lara looked out of touch during his brief stay at the crease before chipping a simple catch to Shane Warne at midwicket 
West Indies tour manager Clive Lloyd has apologised for Lara s behaviour on Tuesday 
He Lara had told Australia coach Geoff Marsh that wicketkeeper Ian Healy was unwelcome in the visitors dressing room 
The Melbourne crowd were clearly angered by the incident loudly jeering the West Indies vicecaptain as he walked to the middle 
It was left to fellow lefthander Shivnarine Chanderpaul to hold the innings together with a gritty 54 despite the handicap of an injured groin 
Chanderpaul was forced to rely on a runner for most of his innings after hurting himself as he scurried back to his crease to avoid being run out

CRICKET LARA SUFFERS MORE AUSTRALIAN TOUR MISERY 
MELBOURNE 19961206 
West Indies batsman Brian Lara suffered another blow to his Australian tour after already being disciplined for misconduct when he was dismissed cheaply in the first limited overs match against Australia on Friday 
Lara who earned a stern rebuke from his own tour management after an angry outburst against Australia wicketkeeper Ian Healy scored five to prolong a run of poor form with the bat 
The West Indies vicecaptain struggled for timing during his 36minute stay at the crease before chipping a ball from medium pacer Tom Moody straight to Shane Warne at midwicket 
West Indies were 53 for two in 15 overs when rain stopped play at the Melbourne Cricket Ground after captain Courtney Walsh won the toss and elected to bat 
Lara s outburst three days ago has clearly turned some of the Australian public against him 
As he walked to the wicket he was greeted by loud jeers from sections of the crowd 
On several occasions during his innings the crowd joined together in a series of obscene chants against him 
Tour manager Clive Lloyd on Wednesday apologised for Lara s behaviour in confronting Australia coach Geoff Marsh in the opposition dressing room to protest against his dismissal in the second test on Tuesday 
Lloyd did not say what form the discipline would take 
Lara who holds the record for the highest score in test and firstclass cricket was unhappy about Healy s role in the incident and questioned whether the ball had carried to the Australia keeper 
Australia went on to win the match at the Sydney Cricket Ground by 124 runs to take a twonil lead in the fivetest series after Lara failed in both innings 
Lara has yet to score a century since West Indies arrived in Australia five weeks ago 
Both West Indies and Australia team management have played down the incident stressing that relations between the two sides have not been adversely affected

Marshall Faulk rushed for 101 yards and two touchdowns and Jason Belser returned an interception 44 yards for a score as the Colts improved to 86 the same mark as the Eagles who lost for the fourth time in five games 
Paul Justin starting for the sidelined Jim Harbaugh was 14of23 for 144 yards and a touchdown for the the Colts who played their last home game of the season

Thirdstringer Kerwin Bell a 1988 draft choice of the Miami Dolphins made his NFL debut and was 5of5 for 75 yards including a 20yard scoring strike to Marvin Harrison in the third period 
A 39yard interference penalty against Philadelphia s Troy Vincent set up Faulk s first score around left end that capped an 80yard march 517 into the game and the rout was on 
Eagles quarterback Ty Detmer was 17of34 for 182 yards before he was benched 
Ricky Watters who leads the NFC in rushing left the game after getting kneed to the helmet after gaining 33 yards on seven carries

SOCCER FIFA BOSS HAVELANGE STANDS BY WEAH 
ROME 19961206 
FIFA chairman Joao Havelange said on Friday he would personally present AC Milan George Weah with world soccer s fair play award despite the striker s attack on Porto captain Jorge Costa 
In an interview with the Italian newspaper Gazzetta dello Sport he was quoted as saying Weah had been provoked into the assault which left Costa with a broken nose 
FIFA has named the Liberian for its 1996 Fair Play award and it is not going to change its decision Havelange said 
A reaction provoked cannot erase 10 years of loyalty everywhere and in every competition 
I will be happy to give him the award personally on January 20 in Lisbon and I m confident that Costa himself will be there beside me on that day to shake his hand 
Weah was suspended for one match by UEFA European soccer s governing body pending a fuller investigation 
The incident took place in the players tunnel after a European Champions League match on November 20 
Weah has admitted head butting Costa but said he reacted to racist taunts 
He has offered to apologise if Costa acknowledges the provocation 
Costa who needed surgery on his nose has not accepted the offer and was reported to be considering suing Weah 
Weah served out his suspension during Milan s 21 home defeat by Rosenborg of Norway on Wednesday 
The defeat put the Italians out of the Europoean Cup

GUNMEN KILL FOUR IN SAFRICA S ZULU PROVINCE 
DURBAN South Africa 19961206 
At least four people have been shot dead in two suspected political attacks in South Africa s volatile Zulu heartland police said on Friday 
A police spokesman said two youths believed to be supporters of President Nelson Mandela s African National Congress ANC had been killed when unknown gunmen opened fire at the rural settlement of Izingolweni on KwaZuluNatal province s south coast on Thursday night 
The victims were 18 and 20 he said adding one other youth had been wounded in the shooting 
In another attack also on the province s south coast on Thursday night two men were shot dead near Umkomaas 
We suspect that these killings are linked to politics spokesman Bala Naidoo told Reuters 
There had been no arrests 
The killings came just hours after violence monitors said they were not optimistic of a peaceful festive season in KwaZuluNatal and pointed the south coast region where 18 people were massacred last Christmas as one of potential hot spots 
They said the recent lull in political feuding could be upset as thousands of migrant workers some tense with grudges brewed in the cities and keen to settle old scores flock back to their home villages 
More than 14000 people have lost their lives in over a decade of political turf wars between the ANC and Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi s Inkatha Freedom Party in the province

PRAGUE 19961206 
Czech President Vaclav Havel on Friday welcomed the appointment of Madeleine Albright who is of Czech extraction as the United States first woman Secretary of State 
In a statement Havel who is recovering from cancer surgery said Madeleine Albright is a distinguished friend a tested diplomat and a true American of fine origins 
I look forward to continuing our good relations 
with the United States and with the first woman ever to hold the position of Secretary of State 
I wish her well Havel said in a statement to Reuters 
Havel who helped lead the velvet revolution that ousted the Communist regime in Prague in 1989 invited Albright then working for a private foreign policy think tank to advise his new democratic government in 1990 
Havel had a small malignant tumour removed from his lung on Monday and is recovering in hospital 
Albright born Marie Korbelova to a Czechoslovak diplomat in 1937 fled with her family to the United States after the Communists came to power in a coup in 1948 
As an academic Albright studied and lectured on Europe s 20th century problems before becoming US ambassador to the United Nations 
Czech diplomats seeking to have their country included in the expected expansion of NATO praised the selection of Albright known to be a strong supporter of alliance s integration of former Soveitbloc countries 
The nomination 
is a clear signal that one key of the lines of foreign policy will be the strengthening of the transAtlantic cooperation a creation of strategic partnership between Europe and the US Foreign Minister Josef Zieleniec told Reuters 
Albright is a convinced advocate of NATO enlargement and of stabilisation of security structures 
Czech ambassador to the United Nations Karel Kovanda told the daily Mlada Fronta Dnes that Albright is a little light in our diplomatic heaven but warned against expecting her to exert any influence in favour of the Czechs

CZECH VICEPM SEES WIDER DEBATE AT PARTY CONGRESS 
PRAGUE 19961206 
Saturday s national congress of the ruling Czech Civic Democratic Party ODS will discuss making the party more efficient and transparent Foreign Minister and ODS vicechairman Josef Zieleniec said on Friday 
Modernisation and more profesionalism of the party s structure having financing of the party be more transparent 
are absolutely fundamental Zieleniec who is also vicepremier in the government told Reuters 
He said after June general elections in which the ruling threeparty coalition lost its parliamentary majority the ODS executive led by Prime Minister Vaclav Klaus had developed proposals on these subjects to present at the congress on Saturday in the Czech second city Brno 
I am convinced that the congress will tackle these proposals he said 
The ODS a party in which Klaus often tries to emulate the style of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher has been in control of Czech politics since winning general elections in 1992 
Zieleniec in the summer led calls for the party and its leadership to listen to more diverse opinions a thinlyveiled criticism of Klaus who has spearheaded the country s postCommunist economic reforms 
The party led by the vigorouslyconfident Klaus took 32 of 81 seats after late November runoff elections to the new upper house of Czech parliament 
But after the first round vote a week before the ODS had the potential to win as many 79 seats 
Klaus and his coalition lost its majority in parliament in June lower house elections after the leftwing opposition consolidated putting the centreleft Social Democrats in a strong secondplace position

POLAND GOT MONEY FROM POSTWAR SWISS ACCOUNTS 
Marcin Grajewski 
WARSAW 19961206 
Poland said on Friday that Swiss bank accounts which in many cases belonged to Polish Jews who died in the Holocaust were used in debt settlements between the two countries after the World War Two 
Foreign Minister Dariusz Rosati unveiling first findings of a special government commission said that in 1970s the then communist Poland received 460000 Swiss francs from the accounts 
In 1970s Poland received from unclaimed accounts in Switzerland a sum of 460000 francs 
What was its right to the money I do not know Rosati told a news conference 
Switzerland stands accused by Senator Alfonse DAmato chairman of the powerful US Senate Banking Committee of agreeing to give money to Poland from unclaimed bank accounts of Polish citizens as part of an accord on compensating Swiss nationals whose assets had been seized in communist Poland 
Many of these citizens were Jews murdered during the war when Nazi German invaders killed most of Poland s 35 million Jews 
Rosati did not say whether the payment in 1970s was part of the 1949 agreement between Warsaw and Switzerland on compensation to Swiss citizens whose assets were seized by the Sovietimposed communists authorities after World War Two 
I expect that the commission will finish gathering information within two to three weeks and then more details will be provided Rosati said 
Rosati confirmed that the 1949 agreement had provided for granting Switzerland about 53 million francs and most of this sum was repaid with coal exports 
He said however that Switzerland did get about 16000 francs from the socalled dead accounts as part of the compensation 
About 16000 francs were seized from accounts of four or five Polish citizens whose data we do not precisely know 
The issue is of moral and legal nature because its financial significance is small Rosati said 
Under pressure from international Jewish organisations Swiss government has devised a plan to pay out millions of dollars in unclaimed bank accounts as a conciliatory gesture toward Holocaust victims 
The conservative Radical Democrats FDP have said they would ask parliament next week to order Swiss banks to put some 40 million Swiss francs 31 million in dormant wealth into a fund earmarked for Jewish groups and charitable organisations 
But Swiss banks and the country s Jewish community voiced doubts whether the plan would work

INTERVIEWZYWIEC SEES NO BIG 97 NET RISE 
Steven Silber 
WARSAW 19961206 
Polish brewer Zywiec s 1996 profit slump may last into next year due in part to hefty depreciation charges but recent high investment should help the firm defend its 10percent market share the firm s chief executive said 
Company President Jean van Boxmeer told Reuters in an interview on Friday that the firm whose net profit fell 77 percent in the first 10 months of 1996 despite a 30percent rise in sales might only post slightly better profits in 1997 before having a chance to make a more significant turnaround 
So far this year Zywiec whose full name is Zaklady Piwowarskie w Zywcu SA has netted six million zlotys on sales of 224 million zlotys 
It has produced 15 million hectolitres 
Van Boxmeer would not say how much higher 1997 profits or market share could be but said sales of leading Polish brewers should rise as the country s young urban professionals gradually switch from vodka to beer 
The perspective on growth is such that reasonably we can think that somewhere between 65 and 80 litres per year is certainly reachable van Boxmeer said on Polish percapita beer consumption currently around 40 litres 
He said the 6580litre level could be reached in the next ten years and make Poland with its 40million population Europe s third largest beer market after Germany and Britain 
Van Boxmeer said Poland s top five brewers which produce about 55 percent of the country s beer could all raise market share as some of the numerous small brewers fall to competition from the large brewers with foreign investors 
Zywiec is 318percent owned by Heineken while Carlsberg has the same amount in Okocim 
Earlier this year South African Breweries Ltd SAB bought strategic stakes in the unlisted Lech and Tychy brewers which together hold more than 20 percent of the market and Australia s Brewpole BV has a controlling stake in Poland s larges t brewery Elbrewery Company Ltd EB 
Van Boxmeer said the tough competition had prevented Zywiec from raising prices in line with inflation which had added to the pressure on the firm s margins 
He said advertising costs would also increase in the fight for market share 
But he said the company s investment of more than 100 million already this decade largely in production would help position it to compete with such competitors as brewers from the neighbouring Czech Republic 
Some analysts say cheaper but highquality Czech imports could invade Poland once tariffs for CEFTA countries are lifted in 1998 but van Boxmeer says such a threat might be exaggerated despite the Czech beer market s overcapacity 
I think Polish consumers in general are quite proud of their beers and I m speaking about all the brands and as we make good beers 
I think that this fidelity to our beers is a factor which can limit the Czech beers he said 
Van Boxmeer said Zywiec had its eye on Okocim which has said it would start producing Carlsberg beer next year but that Zywiec s potential production of Heineken was a mediumterm possibility rather than a shortterm one 
He said his firm would be better off concentrating on its leading brand Zywiec Full Light which accounts for 85 percent of sales and is the country s largestselling brand 
You will not win the war of the Polish beer market with imported international brands van Boxmeer said adding that Heineken would remain an upmarket import in Poland 
Van Boxmeer also said Zywiec would be boosted by its recent shedding of soft drinks which only accounted for about three percent of the firm s overall sales and for which 76 million zlotys in provisions had already been made

Britain sets conditions to clear American alliance 
Edna Fernandes 
LONDON 19961206 
The British government warned Friday that it would refer the proposed transAtlantic alliance between British Airways Plc and American Airlines to Britain s Monopolies and Mergers Commission unless the carriers complied with a number of conditions 
Trade and Industry Secretary Ian Lang added that even if the conditions were met by both airlines final clearance would hinge on an open skies deal between Britain and the United States to liberalise transAtlantic air traffic which would create greater competition on the routes 
Lang said he supported conditions proposed by Britain s Office of Fair Trading which was asked to examine the case last month 
I agree that without suitable undertakings the alliance would be likely to lead to a significant loss of actual and potential passengers on those routes where BA and AA currently compete and for all passengers on the transAtlantic market route between the UK and US he said 
His comments came just minutes after the latest set of open skies talks ended in London with no deal signed 
Industry sources said there was no new date for fresh talks and blamed the deadlock on uncertainty over whether the British AirwaysAmerican deal would be cleared 
The conditions for clearance of the alliance were that British Airways and American drop 168 slots at London Heathrow airport the busiest in Europe 
American s parent AMR Corp said it did not view the terms as a deal breaker 
However it called the conditions more severe than those imposed by other regulatory authorities on similar airline alliances 
British Airways s initial response was that unconditional divestiture of slots is unprecedented and if done it must be on the basis of fair market value 
It added that it would be prepared to take reasonable steps to assist the introduction of additional competition 
The government also wants British Airways to drop a clause in its agreement with USAir that bars it from competing on transAtlantic routes and said both British Airways and American should be prepared to reduce services on the London to DallasFort Worth route in the event that a new entrant wishes to enter 
It also suggested losing some slots on the LondontoBoston route 
The Office of Fair Trade called for British Airways American to allow thirdparty access to their joint frequent flyer programme where the applicant does not have access to an equivalent programme 
Lang said responses should be made to the Office of Fair Trading by Jan 10 1997

Trades were discussed in 02 05 and one percent heating oil into Syria and Lebanon and there were fresh inquiries from France and Spain for low sulphur diesel 
Interest remains focussed on a tender by India for a second purchase of high speed diesel for January delivery 
Fuel oil lost ground sharply with weaker crude but also suffered from some pricing pressure 
High sulphur cracked fuel lost about 3 to 109111 fob Med with several cargoes threatening to overhang the market 
The chance of material heading north talked earlier this week may be in jeopardy now since American fuel oil is expected to head transatlantic following outages at two coking units in the US

NYC Jan refunding has its 1st Euro floating rate 
NEW YORK 19961206 
New York City on Friday said that it planned a 775 million refunding for January that will include its first floating rate issue of taxable debt for European investors 
A city official who declined to be named explained that Goldman Sachs which this summer was demoted to the second tier of the syndicate proposed the floating rate issue and as a result was promoted to book runner for this offering 
By selling the floating rate debt the city hopes to establish a benchmark the city official said adding that it needed a large deal to accomplish this objective 
The city in late June sold its first issue of Euronotes a strategy that it says saved it 500000 in interest costs and it has been trying to build on this strategy of expanding the pool of potential investors since then 
In November New York City said it became the first US municipality to offer bonds for sale in European markets by competitive bidding as it listed taxable bonds on the London Stock Exchange 
The refunding planned for January also includes a 475 million taxexempt offering 
No specific date in January has been selected for the debt sale the official added

Wall Street since the bid has speculated that any deal between Newmont and Santa Fe would be a bear hug or a reluctantly negotiated agreement where the buyer is not necessarily a friendly suitor 
Newmont said the companies have had previous contact though declined to detail the encounters 
Analysts predict Santa Fe will go to the highest bidder and that if a rival buyer is found Newmont may not be able to match its offer 
They said the Santa Fe deal which includes desirable Nevada mining territory would only payoff for Newmont longer term 
Newmont in fact will not benefit from the Santa Fe acquisition on an earnings basis for at least two years which also limits its capacity to raise its offer 
Any deal friendly or hostile would almost assuredly be a stock swap which is necessary to preserve the taxfree poolingofinterest accounting they said 
Analysts and arbitrageurs immediately ruled out Barrick Gold Corp and BreX Minerals Ltd as Santa Fe saviors because they are locked in negotiations over their splitting Indonesia s Busang vast gold deposit 
Placer Dome Inc too was considered unlikley because it is focusing on geographic expansion in areas that do match Santa Fe s Nevada South America and Central Asia presence they said 
A Homestake spokesman was not immediately available to comment on speculation that it tops the list 
Homestake based in San Francisco operates gold mines in the United States Australia Chile and Canada 
Earnings in 1995 were 022 per share or 303 million on revenues of 7463 million 
Santa Fe is headquartered Albuquerque NM and reported 1995 earnings of 030 per share or 40 million on revenues of 350 million 
Santa Fe has mining and exploration operations in Nevada California Montana Canada Brazil Australia Chile Kazakstan Mexico and Ghana 
PaineWebber analyst Marc Cohen said he lowered his rating on Newmont to neutral from attractive today because if Newmont merged with Santa Fe investors would have to wait until the second half of 1998 to realize earnings accretion 
I think Homestake could come in as a white knight but how much is someone willing to come in above the Newmont number 
One would have to outbid by at least 15 percent but there is going to be a Santa Fe deal with someone he said 
Longer term two to three years out a NewmontSanta Fe deal is positive it does all the right things 
But in the nearterm it is at worst neutral the analyst added 
Newmont proposed to Santa Fe a stockswap merger at a ratio of 033 Newmont shares for each Santa Fe shares 
In Friday New York Stock Exchange trade Newmonth was off 12 to 4658 while Santa Fe added 14 to 1518 
Newmont said it wants to discuss a friendly deal with Santa Fe which is almost always a euphemism for We have more money in our pocket said an arb referring to a possible sweetened bid from Newmont 
Two other arbs called Newmont s move a a 32 cent bid because there is no formal tender offer only the proposal letter mailed to Santa Fe s board

Multinational commander going back to east Zaire 
Jonathan Wright 
NAIROBI 19961206 
The Canadian general in charge of a multinational force for eastern Zaire said on Friday he was going back to Zaire for more information about the plight of about 165000 Rwandan refugees adrift in the countryside 
LieutenantGeneral Maurice Baril told a news conference in Nairobi his main concern was for a large group of about 150000 refugees living off the land in a valley about 65 km 40 miles west of the eastern city of Goma 
If he decided it was necessary and safe for the aircrew he would not hesitate to order airdrops of food for the refugees even against the wishes of the government in Kinshasa and the Zairean rebels who control much of eastern Zaire he said 
Tomorrow I m going into Rwanda and my intention is to go across into eastern Zaire and try to find out for the second time what the situation is on the ground he said 
General Baril saw rebel leader Laurent Kabila in Goma last week but the rebels told him the crisis was over because most of the Rwandan refugees have already gone home 
The rebels do not want the multinational force to deploy on the ground for fear it might help the Zairean army regain control of the area 
Kinshasa opposes airdrops apparently because the food could fall into the hands of the rebels and their local supporters 
Canadian Defence Minister Doug Young said on Thursday that the multinational force would probably not have to make food airdrops or intervene militarily in any major way 
It does nt look as though they airdrops are going to be required in any significant way because the NGOs nongovernmental organisations are in that area on the border between Zaire and Rwanda Young told reporters 
But General Baril said it would be premature to rule out any course of action until he had more information 
We hope that if the front moves forward or stabilises then we will have access to the large group of refugees with reconnaissance or humanitarian agencies 
If they ca nt move because they are too weak then we will probably consider very seriously using air delivery means airdrops It s complex it s dangerous for the air crew that fly in there and it will have to be absolutely necessary 
If it is necessary I wo nt hesitate to use it he said 
Asked if he would disregard the objections of the Zairean government he said It would have to be in the last resort 
It would have to mean that tens of thousands of lives are in danger 
Do you think that I would have a conscience problem doing it or not at that time 
And my mandate is also under Chapter Seven to operate in eastern Zaire 
Under Chapter Seven of the UN charter the Security Council has wide powers to preserve peace and security 
I know their the Zairean government s position and I know it s very delicate and we are very sensitive to their position also the general added 
He denied that his contacts criticised by Kinshasa with the Zairean rebels amounted to negotiations 
I do nt negotiate he said 
I coordinate with those who are holding ground and that s a wise thing to do 
When we do nt know where the front is we do nt know what the risk is 
Baril said that apart from the group of 150000 US and British reconnaissance plans had tracked two much smaller groups of refugees one of up to 1000 north of the town of Masisi and one of up to 8000 on the road from Bukavu west to Kindu 
The Kisangani office of the medical charity Medecins sans Frontieres said on Friday that more than 100000 refugees were trekking northwest from the GomaBukavu area and many of them were now in the town of Walikale 
The general did not mention these refugees who are on the outer limit of the strip the planes have been checking

Exminister son killed in Central Africa unrest

BANGUI 19961206 
A former cabinet minister in Central African Republic and his son were abducted from their home and murdered in growing ethnic violence in the capital Bangui a government minister said on Friday 
With violence spiralling out of control France voiced backing for the elected Bangui government but said its troops based in the former colony under defence pacts would not help it combat army mutineers 
France cannot be involved in the domestic political debate President Jacques Chirac told a news conference at the end of a FrancoAfrican summit in Burkina Faso 
French troops may only take part in maintaining order to avoid major abuses and protect foreign communities he said 
Public Service Minister David Dofara who is the head of the national Red Cross told Reuters he had seen the bodies of former interior minister Christophe Grelombe and his son who was not named 
Witnesses said they had been seized by troops loyal to President AngeFelix Patasse at dawn on Thursday when they clashed with soldiers staging a mutiny since November 16 
Grelombe is from the Yakoma tribe to which most of the rebel soldiers belong 
The uprising began over pay demands but has turned into a campaign to topple Patasse sparking ethnic violence and dividing the capital 
The former minister and his son had been taken from their home close to the presidential palace which is guarded by loyalist soldiers backed by French troops based in Bangui 
The bodies were found on Thursday in an open field about two km one mile further away said Dofora and other witnesses 
The men were seized as loyalist forces and French troops fought gunbattles with mutineers who fired rockets into the city centre 
A Frenchowned hotel was slightly damaged 
Yakomas are hounded in stronghold districts of Patasse s Baya people while other tribes have fled areas in rebel hands 
Roadblocks have been erected in city districts while central Bangui which is patrolled by French troops with tanks is deserted 
Shops and businesses have remained shut this week 
The FrancoAfrican summit decided to send a mission Bangui to seek ways of containing the mutiny and a threat of civil war 
Chirac said Burkina Faso President Blaise Compaore would visit Bangui in the coming hours with the heads of state of Gabon Mali and Chad to try and establish dialogue between authorities and rebels 
The mutiny forced Patasse to miss the summit 
His spokesman had predicted the meeting to send an assessment mission 
Patasse who won Central Africa s first multiparty elections refuses to resign 
Churchled meadiation attempts hit deadlock over rebel demands for his departure 
Soldiers staged mutinies in April and May with French troops stepping in with tanks and helicopters to quell the more serious second uprising 
Patasse offered concessions and amnesty to rebels before the May rebellion ended after rebels looted the city centre 
Rebels accuse Patasse of tribalism and of arming his civilian supporters and hired guns from Sudan and Chad 
Mutineers have vowed to disarm all civilians and to chase out the foreign forces knwon as Codos 
Hospital sources and witnesses said about 10 people were known to have been killed in the more than two weeks of fighting including two rebels killed in Thursday s clashes 
An undetermined number of people are reported to have been abducted and killed outside the town by tribal vigilante groups 
In Thursday s fighting French troops fired back as mutineers trying to break out of their strongholds rained mortar shells on the city centre

Polish excommunist president to visit Pope

Poland s excommunist President Aleksander Kwasniewski is likely to visit Polishborn Pope John Paul in early 1997 despite uneasy relations between the Vatican and Warsaw the foreign minister said on Friday 
President Kwasniewski plans to visit Italy on a invitation from President Oscar Scalfaro 
A meeting with the Pope is also planned Dariusz Rosati told a news conference 
Rosati said that the atmosphere of the meeting if it takes place would largely depend on the progress in talks on ratification of a treaty between Warsaw and the Vatican 

The ratification of the treaty which was signed in 1993 by the then rightcentrist government is being delayed by an excommunist party which won parliamentary elections in the same year and now dominates parliament 
The party the Democratic Left Alliance says the agreement would give the Catholic Church too much influence over life in Poland and could infringe on rights of other religious groups and nonbelievers 
The relations with the Vatican have also been soured by a recent relaxation of Poland s antiabortion rules which Kwasniewski signed into law last month

Russia warns Norilsk not expected to liquidate it 
Lynnley Browning 
MOSCOW 19961206 
Russian Finance Minister Alexander Livshits warned financiallytroubled Norilsk Nickel on Friday that it must pay overdue taxes but analysts said the firm would not be liquidated or that its would assets would be frozen 
Norilsk really is a big debtor both to the federal and regional budgets said Konstantin Chernyshev equities analyst at Moscow brokerage Rinaco Plus and a Norilsk watcher 
Livshits s words are an attempt to put pressure on the company 
The official ItarTass news agency quoted Livshits as telling parliamentary deputies that RAO Norilsky Nikel 0NKELRUO had to pay its tax arrears and that bankruptcy procedures applied to the metals group 
If it was an unsolicited statement and a bolt out of the blue then it obviously means something said Christopher Granville chief economist at United City Bank in Moscow 
But if it was a response to a deputy s question that was essentially loaded then it was the only answer he could have given 
Russian tax and cabinet authorities under pressure from the International Monetary Fund to boost tax revenues as a condition for receiving payments of a 10 billion threeyear loan to Moscow have been striking fear into the hearts of some of Russia s most prominent industrial firms by saying they must pay up or face liquidation 
They could freeze metal but it s not a longterm solution to the problem and would nt put money in the budget Chernyshev said 
I do nt think they would do that 
Entire social infrastructures in the icy Far North where Norilsk is based depend on the company and Moscow has said it has no finances to resettle hundreds of thousands of people an expenditure which could far outstrip Norilsk s debts 
Norilsk officials declined to comment 
Analysts said the government while anxious about Norilsk s debts is highly unlikely to bring the nickel copper cobalt platinum and platinum group metals producer to its knees or take measures that could significantly affect output 
But it also wants Norilsk the world s secondlargest nickel producer to clean up its act 
The procedure of bankruptcy will be applied Tass quoted Livshits as telling Duma deputies about Norilsk 
It indirectly quoted him as saying Norilsk should first pay salary arrears which in the past have led to worker strikes 
It is unlikely that Norilsk will pay these debts in the nearterm the company will remain a debtor in the near future Chernyshev said 
He estimated the company s regional debts at least one trillion roubles and said 30 percent of the giant Krasnoyarsk regional budget was fuelled by Norilsk money 
Norilsk s new majority shareholder Russian commerical bank Uneximbank has said it is reorganising metal exports through Interrosimpex in order to boost revenues 
But the changes have yet to improve significantly Norilsk s situation 
Uneximbank has inherited a mountain and whether or not they climb out and over it remains to be seen said one metals source 
Norilsk said in September that it total debts including unpaid salaries to workers were 13 trillion roubles 
The company said last month that it had worked out a tax payment schedule with authorities after regional tax officials threatened to seize some nickel and copper assets

Plastic surgery gets boost in Brazil 
Simona de Logu 
RIO DE JANEIRO 19961206 
Plastic surgery is booming especially among men as Brazilians spend much of their newfound wealth on the latest beauty treatments said the organisers of a fourday international plastic surgery conference that opened on Friday 
The number of plastic surgeries in Brazil has jumped 30 percent to an estimated 150000 this year since an antiinflation plan was introduced in July 1994 Farid Hakme the president of the Brazilian Plastic Surgery Society SBCP said 
The number of operations on men increased even more by 80 percent from 8000 in 1994 to 15000 in 1995 he said 
Brazil ranks right at the top for plastic surgery with respect to the number of surgeons the number of patients number of operations number of conferences 
Our statistics are the highest for everything Hakme said 
We believe the increase in plastic surgeries for men results from the difficulties in the job market 
People need to have a more youthful look to compete in the job market given the profound changes in Latin America s economy 
A controlled exchange rate trade liberalisation and tight monetary policies have also dramatically curbed inflation making more money available for cosmetic surgery 
Brazil has been at the forefront in plastic surgery for decades and is home to one of the most famous surgeons Ivo Pitangy 
There are 6000 plastic surgeons there of which 4500 have qualified to be members of the SBCP 
Every year 500 new plastic surgeons graduate in Brazil and medical students from all over the world come to study there 
Hakme attributes Brazil s fascination with plastic surgery not to excessive vanity but to the country s mix and match of different races which can create physical disharmonies 
What happens is the nose sometimes does nt match the mouth or the buttocks do nt match with the legs he said 
Brazil s most soughtafter beauty treatment is liposuction in which fat is sucked away from areas of the body with about 30000 operations a year at a cost of 3000 to 4000 each 
Stomach tucks and breast operations are also popular since the tropical climate calls for fleshbaring fashions but unlike women elsewhere Brazilians tend to have breast reductions and buttock implants 
The women who want to reduce their breasts here would probably want to increase them in the United States SBCP VicePresident Oswaldo Saldanha said 
Beauty ideals and cultures are different in every country 
Plastic surgery scares like the case in which Brazilian model Claudia Liz fell into a coma after being anaesthetised for a liposuction in October are not much of a deterrent 
Saldanha said operations fell 30 percent immediately after that case but the rate was back to normal now

He was responding to questions at a news conference called to discuss next week s ministerial meeting of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference OIC in Jakarta 
Ramos Horta has been a vocal leader of the opposition to Jakarta s rule in the territory 
Belo and Ramos Horta were awared the prize for their efforts to secure a peaceful solution to the issue of East Timor a former Portuguese colony which Indonesia invaded in 1975 and annexed the following year 
The United Nations has never recognised Jakarta s move 
Alatas said the government s position on the Nobel Peace Prize would have been different if it had been awarded solely to Belo 
Asked if the Indonesian ambassador to Norway would have attended the ceremony if only Belo had been involved Alatas replied Probably yes but that is a hypothetical question 
Alatas said on Tuesday that on his way back from Oslo Belo would visit the Vatican to see the Pope and would also meet German Chancellor Helmut Kohl in Bonn 
Kohl had wanted to meet Belo during the chancellor s official visit to Indonesia last month but the bishop was too busy in East Timor to come to Jakarta

Government disperses protest with water cannons 
RANGOON 19961207 
Burmese troops and riot police moved in to disperse a student street protest at a suburban road junction near the Ranyon Rangoon University early on Saturday witnesses said 
They said police and troops used water cannons from fire engines to subdue about 120 university students sitting in at the centre of the junction at about 3 am before they moved in to round them up 
The students who had staged an 11hour protest at the junction in northern Rangoon were taken away in three vehicles 
The witnesses said some of the students were hit with batons while they were herded onto the vehicles and it was believed they were taken to the Insein prison in suburban Rangoon 
The protesting students mostly from Rangoon University were demanding the right to organise independent unions on campuses and the release of about 80 student leaders currently in jail 
They were among 500 students who started demonstrating at the intersection on late Friday afternoon 
The protest was the second major one in five days in the capital

Burmese students march briefly out of campus 
Vithoon Amorn 
RANGOON 19961206 
About 200 Burmese students marched briefly from troubled Yangon Institute of Technology in northern Rangoon on Friday towards the University of Yangon six km four miles away and returned to their campus witnesses said 
Seven truckloads of armed riot police and three fire engines were on standby at one of the junctions near the institute 
There were no clashes 
They are now back in the YIT campus an institute official who declined to be identified told Reuters by telephone 
One of two roads leading to the University of Yangon from the institute had been closed by authorities 
But about 300 university students were still gathered outside the gates of their campus witnesses said 
They were singing peacefully 
On Monday and Tuesday students from the institute and the university launched protests against what they said was unfair handling by police of a brawl between some of their colleagues and restaurant owners in October 
On Tuesday and Wednesday opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi was restricted to her home by the military government to prevent her from being drawn into the protests 
She was allowed to move freely on Thursday 
The protest culminated at dawn on Tuesday with several hundred students being detained briefly by police in central Rangoon 
The street protests were the biggest seen in the capital since the studentled prodemocracry demonstrations of September 1988 when the junta crushed the uprising 
Thousands were killed or imprisoned 
Earlier on Friday some of the students who were held briefly by police during the protests earlier this week said they were still dissatisfied with the military government 
They told Reuters they were unhappy that the ruling State Law and Order Restoration Council SLORC had not heeded their calls for the right to organise independent unions on campus 
We still want government answers to our demands 
We want police punishment to be published in newspapers one student said 
But the students stressed their protests were nonpolitical and they had no contact with Suu Kyi s National League for Democracy NLD 
Suu Kyi a Nobel laureate and daughter of independence hero Aung San and key NLD officials have also denied any link with the students 
But they have said both parties had a moral link in that they were against police brutality and injustice 
The students also demanded the government announce punishments meted out to policemen who they said had manhandled students involved in a brawl with some restaurant owners near the Yangon institute in October 
The students appealed to the government not to close the institute because of their latest demonstration 
The institute was shut for nearly two years after the 1988 uprising 
On Friday the road leading to Suu Kyi s lakeside residence in central Rangoon remained closed by police

Union leaders outraged by WTO snub to ILO head 
SINGAPORE 19961206 
International trade union leaders on Friday expressed outrage that the head of the International Labour Organisation ILO had been barred from speaking at next week s WTO meeting in Singapore 
Bill Jordan general secretary of the International Confederation of Free Trade Unions ICFTU told a news conference the withdrawal of a WTO invitation to ILO director general Michel Hansenne was outrageous behaviour on the part of an organisation that wants to command respect in the world 
Jordan said a small group of developing nations that oppose linking trade talks and labour conditions had pressured World Trade Organisation WTO officials to prevent Hansenne from taking the platform to urge such links 
It is to their shame that those who are responsible for encouraging this meeting responded to the pressure in silencing him Jordan said after the opening of an ICFTU conference on international labour standards and trade 
The threeday trade union conference in Singapore hopes to push labour issues onto the WTO agenda 
Jordan said the WTO s credibility was at stake over the issue of trade and labour 
The ICFTU said it wanted the WTO conference beginning on Monday to outlaw forced and child labour end discrimination in hiring and guarantee the right to join a union 
Bill Brett chairman of the ILO Workers Group told Reuters before the news conference he was not too surprised but very disappointed that the speaking invitation had been withdrawn 
Some governments are very determined to stop the issue of trade and labour rights being discussed he said adding that the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN seemed particularly hostile to the ILO agenda 
ASEAN groups Brunei Indonesia Malaysia the Philippines Singapore Thailand and Vietnam 
The ILO wants a trade and labour rights social clause included in the final ministerial statement issued by WTO leaders at the end of the meeting the organization s first ministeriallevel gathering 
Speaking to ICFTU delegates Richard Eglin director of the WTO secretariat said the WTO was capable of making a significant contribution to governmental efforts to solve social problems 
But he said the WTO s organisational structure made it difficult to impose on its members a social clause such as that called for by the ILO

Indian rubber demand seen outstripping production 
SINGAPORE 19961206 
Indian rubber demand is seen outpacing local production in the 199697 April March season and the trend will persist way into the next century the chairman of the Rubber Board of India said on Friday 
KJ Matthew said at the Asia Rubber Markets meeting here Indian production of natural rubber in 199697 will reach 547000 tonnes against projected demand of 578000 tonnes a gap of 31000 tonnes 
For synthetic rubber production reached 68200 tonnes in 199596 while consumption in the same season hit 134085 tonnes Matthew added 
Though schemes designed to realise further increases in the production of natural rubber are being operated successfully the demandsupply gap is expected to widen he said 
Indian synthetic rubber output is not expected to rise significantly in the next season but demand will rise to 145000 tonnes 
Matthew estimates that by the 200001 season the gap between natural rubber output and consumption will rise to 51000 tonnes and 319000 tonnes in 201011 
Natural rubber production will go up to 695000 tonnes in 200001 against consumption of 746000 tonnes 
In 201011 domestic demand should rise further to 1233 million tonnes while production will only reach about 914000 tonnes 
One way to bridge the widening gap is to put more land under cultivation which the Rubber Board official estimates will reach 220000 hectares between now and the year 2003 although Matthew said this may not be possible at this time in India 
The development objective for the rubber plantation industry will be to increase production to the best extent possibly with a view to minimising imports of natural rubber he said

Japan s authorities seen seeking to rein in dollar 
George Nishiyama 
TOKYO 19961206 
Comments by Japan s tightlipped central bank chief and an influential top bureaucrat are further signs that the nation s authorities want to keep the dollar at current levels market sources said on Friday 
In a rare expression of a view on currencies by the Bank of Japan BOJ governor Yasuo Matsushita was quoted in Japan s leading economic daily on Friday as saying that he sees no further immediate fall in the yen 
This followed a widely watched television appearance late on Thursday by Eisuke Sakakibara a highranking Finance Ministry official who denied he had said he wants to guide the dollar lower to between 108 and 110 yen 
But many in the market thought Sakakibara s real intentions lay elsewhere and took more notice of his comments about the US government s stance on the dollar dealers said 
I think his views on US Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin s comments were indeed what he himself thinks about the dollar said Hank Note chief dealer at Sumitomo Bank 
Asked about Rubin s comment that a strong dollar was in US interests Sakakibara said the remark does not necessarily mean the United States supports a stronger dollar 
It s a strong dollar not stronger 
In that sense the comments are not pointing to a certain direction he said 
It shows that Sakakibara is not for a stronger dollar either said Sumitomo s Note 
Takao Sakoh first vice president at Union Bank of Switzerland in Tokyo said Maybe a dollar at 10450 yen is not acceptable to Sakakibara but it may be okay at the current level at the lower end of 112 yen 
Market participants have kept a close eye on Sakakibara chief of the ministry s International Finance Bureau as a comment he made in November after the dollar hit this year s high of 11492 yen pushed the currency down sharply 
He had said then that the market s view on Japan s economy was too pessimistic and that he believed it was stronger than the market thought 
Dealers have come to refer to 115 yen as the Sakakibara ceiling for the dollar following the remark 
Adding to the comments by Mr Yen as Sakakibara is known for his prominence in the currency market was BOJ governor Matsushita s remark 
The recent level of the yen exchange rate has been stable and it does not appear to be moving towards a further depreciation of the yen immediately so import prices are likely to stabilise at current levels Matsushita said in an interview with the Nihon Keizai Shimbun 
The fact that he touched on the issue of inflation triggered by import prices shows that the BOJ does not want a further depreciation of the yen past 115 yen said Yasuhito Kawashima chief forex manager at Toyo Trust Banking Co 
Some said the central bank may have been concerned a weaker yen would lead to unfounded pessimism about Japan s economy 
There was concern that foreign investors may sell Japanese stocks if the dollar goes above 115 yen 
The BOJ does not want the yen s weakness to lead to pessimism over the economy said Taisuke Tanaka market strategist with Credit Suisse in Tokyo 
Senior BOJ officials have separately said financial markets views on the economy have been too negative 
I realise there are negative views in the markets about the impact of the consumption tax hike and drop in public spending but the markets appear to be exaggerating the magnitude of the negative impact a senior BOJ official told Reuters on Friday 
The consumption tax is due to raised in April from three to five percent

Lebanon sentences proIsraeli warlord to death 
Haitham Haddadin 
BEIRUT 19961206 
A Lebanese military court on Friday sentenced to death in absentia the commander of Israel s surrogate militia in south Lebanon on treason charges 
The court convicted General Antoine Lahd head of the South Lebanon Army SLA of collaborating with Israel with which Lebanon is officially at war 
Lahd a 69yearold former Lebanese army majorgeneral heads the 3000strong SLA militia which helps Israel hold a border zone in south Lebanon to ward off crossfrontier guerrilla raids on northern Israel 
Lahd said a few days after the trial began on February 16 that Lebanese authorities must drop the charges or risk blocking any peace deal with the Jewish state 
He said Israel was capable of pressuring Lebanon s Syrianbacked government to stop the legal pursuit 
The charges against Lahd were forming a hostile army carrying weapons on Israel s side helping Israel strip off a part of Lebanese territory by violence forming an armed gang killing or trying to kill Lebanese civilians by artillery shelling and kidnapping Lebanese citizens for long periods 
Shortly before Lahd s trial began a Beirut military prosecutor charged another 89 former Lebanese army soldiers with collaborating with Israel 
No date has been set for the trial of the men all members of the SLA living in the Israeliheld zone in south Lebanon 
Israel and Lahd have repeatedly demanded safety guarantees for the SLA a mixed ChristianShiite Moslem force which the Jewish states regards as loyal allies 
Israel has said the Lebanese army must incorporate the SLA fighters into its ranks as an army brigade as a condition for peace 
But Lebanese political analysts have said that would be out of the question and Lebanese authorities preempted the issue by taking legal action against Lahd 
Former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres calling Lahd a great Lebanese patriot said earlier this year Lebanon had insulted the SLA commander by ordering his arrest on the treason charges 
Peres who was ousted in May by rightwing Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu said there could not be real negotiations with Lebanon unless it will stop the maltreatment of the SLA and its commanders 
The Beirut military court also sentenced to life in jail in absentia Etian Saqr former head of the proIsraeli Guardians of the Cedars a small rightwing Christian civil war militia 
Saqr whose trial was concurrent with Lahd s was convicted of contacting the Israeli enemy passing information to Israel and undertaking hostile acts against Lebanon

14 years later Florida man dies for killing 
TALLAHASSEE Fla 19961206 
Fourteen years after he bludgeoned and shot a man whose trailer home he robbed in 1982 John Mills Jr 
41 was put to death in Florida s electric chair Friday 
As Glenn Lawhon a rural Florida minister who is the victim s father looked on Mills was pronounced dead at 713 am EST 1213 GMT for the murder of Lester Lawhon 
Speaking in Arabic Mills made a final statement before an anonymous citizen flipped the switch that sent 2000 volts of electricity through his body said Department of Corrections spokesman Eugene Morris who was present at the execution 
I bear witness that there is no God but Allah and I bear witness that the prophet Mohammed is the messenger of God he quoted Mills as saying 
Prison officials said they had no record of Mills official conversion but they said that on May 14 1991 he had asked that a new name Yuhanna Abdullah Muhammed be added to his prison file which is usually an indication of a conversion to Islam 
Mills is the 38th person to die in Florida s electric chair since the US Supreme Court reversed itself in 1976 and legalised the death penalty 
Prison officials said Mills made no special request for a last meal and did not eat the steak fried potatoes and orange juice offered him 
He spent Thursday with family members and his spiritual adviser Morris said 
Mills was scheduled to die Wednesday but had his sentence temporarily postponed by the Florida Supreme Court 
On Thursday the 11th Circuit US Court of Appeals in Atlanta denied his appeal in federal court 
In March 1982 Mills and accomplice Michael Frederick knocked on the door of Lester Lawhon s trailer in an attempt to rob it police said 
Lester Lawhon was taken to a nearby airstrip where he was bludgeoned with a tire iron 
Mills then fired two shots that killed Lawhon as the victim tried to run away 
Frederick is serving a 347year sentence

Half of dog bites provoked says American vet 
CHICAGO 19961206 
As many as 1 million dog bites are recorded in the United States every year and half of them are provoked by humans a veterinarian told fellow animal doctors on Friday 
The Humane Society of the United States estimates that between 500000 and one million bites are delivered by dogs each year more than half of which are suffered by children 
Most bites can be prevented by teaching children how to respect a dog Michael Cornwell of the Glencoe Animal Hospital in Columbus Ohio told the annual meeting of the American Veterinary Medical Association 
Let s not let our kids jump on them or crawl on them 
Dogs and children do nt have to have an interaction 
Let s respect their territories he said 
Cornwell said 50 percent of reported bites were provoked by a person and 60 percent were suffered by children 
He also estimated that only 25 percent of bites were reported because medical attention was not needed 
Don Rieck president of the National Animal Control Association said aggressiveness in dogs was related more to gender than breed and a male dog that had not been neutered was three times more likely to bite than an unspayed female 
The five breeds credited with the most incidents were chow chows Rottweilers German shepherds cocker spaniels and Dalmatians 
The trends in dog bites by particular breeds have more to do with fad pets owned by individuals who need to have something unique

Four Africans said to vie for top UN post 
Evelyn Leopold 
UNITED NATIONS 19961206 
Four African states are ready to nominate candidates for the post of UN secretarygeneral on Friday now that Boutros BoutrosGhali has temporarily put aside his bid for reelection 
The nominees according to diplomats are Kofi Annan of Ghana the UN undersecretarygeneral for peacekeeping Ahmedou Ould Abdallah of Mauritania the former UN special envoy for Burundi Amara Essy of the Ivory Coast its foreign minister and the UN General Assembly president in 199495 and Hamid Algabid of Niger the secretarygeneral of the Organisation of the Islamic Conference 
Representatives of the UN missions of Ghana the Ivory Coast Mauritania and Niger have scheduled a meeting with Security Council president Paolo Fulci of Italy to hand in the nominations in writing the envoys said 
It was not known if other candidates would step forward 
Diplomats said General Joseph Garba of Nigeria a UN General Assembly president in 198990 was putting forth his own candidacy without being nominated by his country 
BoutrosGhali on Wednesday opened the door for other Africans to contest his job by saying he was suspending temporarily his candidacy but was not withdrawing completely from the race 
His supporters said this meant he remained a candidate in case the race reached an impasse 
The United States on Nov 19 vetoed his bid for reelection while the other 14 Security Council members supported him 
The move by the African states means that the council could begin voting on candidates next week a procedure that could either result in a decision or turn into a bitter fight with vetoes against each nominee 
The Security Council has to vote on a new secretarygeneral and then seek the endorsement of the 185members General Assembly before December 31 when BoutrosGhali s term expires

BRUSSELS 19961206 
The European Union and Poland have resolved disagreements over a new Polish oil import regime the European Commission said on Friday 
The EU had objected to increases in Polish tariffs on imports of gasoline and gasoil products introduced on January 1 1996 saying they contravened levels envisaged in the socalled Europe Agreement between the EU and Poland

Hindu party forces India parliament to adjourn 
NEW DELHI 19961206 
Hindu nationalists forced adjournment of India s lower house of parliament on Friday in protest against a proposal to observe a minute s silence over the destruction of a mosque by a Hindu mob in 1992 
Members of the Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party BJP shouted proHindu slogans in the house after a communist deputy made the proposal in remembrance of the Babri mosque which was razed on December 6 1992 
The house was first adjourned for two hours 
When it reconvened BJP deputies resumed the sloganshouting and deputy speaker Suraj Bhan suspended work until Monday 
The destruction of the 16thcentury mosque in the northern Indian town of Ayodhya triggered nationwide HinduMoslem violence in which more than 3000 people were killed 
Indian officials blame revengeminded Moslem underworld gangs in Bombay for a string of bombings in the city three months later that killed 260 people 
The BJP backs a hardline Hindu campaign to build a temple at the site of the mosque which Hindus believe was the birthplace of the Lord Rama 
The campaign catapulted BJP from the political fringe to become India s main opposition party in 1991

PLO negotiators said on Friday Palestinian President Yasser Arafat Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak might all meet on Saturday to try to clinch a deal on Israel s handover of Hebron to the PLO 
It is very possible that Arafat and Netanyahu will meet in Cairo on Saturday 
There is work on arranging such a meeting hosted by President Mubarak one PLO official who requested anonymity told Reuters 
Israeli officials said no meeting had yet been set 
Arafat s adviser Nabil Abu Rdainah said 
President Arafat is ready to meet Prime Minister Netanyahu but no time or date has been set for such a meeting yet 
President Arafat s position is clear that such a meeting should come after successful negotiations so that the meeting would have positive results 
Especially since the Hebron issue has not been agreed yet and the crucial disputed issues have not been resolved 
But Rdainah said Arafat would go to Cairo on Saturday for talks with Mubarak 
Both Arafat and Netanyahu have expressed willingness to meet 
They last met in Washington after clashes in September that killed 60 Palestinians and 15 Israelis 
The violence was spurred by Israel s opening an entrance to a tunnel near Moslem sites in Jerusalem 
The Palestine Liberation Organisation PLO negotiators said the last two weeks of talks with Israel on implementing the longdelayed handover of most of Hebron to PLO rule had been meaningless necessitating an ArafatNetanyahu meeting 
Mubarak s adviser Osama elBaz said on Thursday there were efforts to arrange a meeting between the Israeli and Palestinian leaders 
Palestinian Authority Secretary General Ahmed AbdelRahman said on Thursday he understood it could be held in Cairo either on Friday or Sunday 
AbdelRahman had said on Thursday he did not think Saturday would be the date because it is the Jewish sabbath 
But the Jewish sabbath ends at sundown so a night meeting would not interfere with the religious observance

It said Kurdistan Workers Party PKK guerrillas sometimes know the layout of mined areas along the border better than the security forces 
Terrorists and smugglers have dug up the mines defused them and opened up wide paths in some areas 
They can come in and out easily as the minefields are not an obstacle it said

US blasts release of convicted bomber 
WASHINGTON 19961205 
The United States Thursday blasted the release from a Greek prison of a Palestinian guerrilla convicted of bombing an airliner and killing a teenager in 1982 saying the move does not make sense 
All of us who have been victimised by terrorists need to stand together against terrorists 
We ca nt let terrorists out of jail when they are a danger to civilians all around the world State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said 
Mohammed Rashid is a terrorist who deserves to be behind bars 
It is inexplicable to us why he would have been allowed to leave Greece before serving his just sentence This is an incomprehensible move 
It does not make sense Burns told a news briefing 
He spoke after Rashid left Greece Thursday on being freed from prison early for good behaviour after serving 812 years 
The Clinton administration s strong views on this subject have been conveyed to the Greek government Burns said 
Mahammad Rashid was whisked from Korydallos maximum security prison just outside Athens to the airport where he boarded a regular Olympic Airways flight to Cairo where he would transit to Tunis and the former Palestine Liberation Organisation headquarters 
Rashid 46 was sentenced to 18 years in prison by a Greek court in 1992 after being convicted of premeditated murder in the midair bombing of a Pan American airliner in 1982 
His sentence had been reduced to 15 years in 1993 
A parole court ruled recently that Rashid could be freed after serving 812 years with time in pretrial detention counted towards his term but said he must be expelled immediately from Greece 
The United States accuses Rashid of belonging to the May 15 Palestinian guerrilla group and being an accomplished student of master Palestinian bombmaker Abu Ibrahim 
Three FBI agents who testified against Rashid during the trial held at Korydallos prison said they had ample evidence against Rashid for a bomb planted on a Pan American plane in Brazil in 1982 and a midair bomb blast on a TWA airliner approaching Athens in 1986 which killed four US citizens

Cyberspace squabbles overshadow copyright talks 
Elif Kaban 
GENEVA 19961206 
In a gloomy Geneva conference centre built before the dawn of the Internet groups of staid officials made a first stab on Friday at rewriting copyright laws for the digital age 
But critics at the first governmentlevel meeting to revise copyright laws in 25 years said the officials and legislators might as well be trying to police the ether 
After four days of diplomatic wrangling over procedures some 600 delegates from nations small and large got down to the nittygritty of setting the digital agenda for the first time 
Cyberspace squabbles overshadowed the debate on a stack of proposals covering literary and artistic works the rights of performers and producers of music and producers of databases 
If it goes on like this we wo nt have enough time to finish all the discussions a frustrated Western delegate said 
They announced they will start evening sessions next week 
Attempts by copyrightbased industries to ensure they get a cut from online works led to a storm of protests by Internet companies and critics who say the pacts would curb public access to online information from soccer results to stock prices 
It s not illegal to make photocopies of newspaper articles 
It s fair use 
We can read sports statistics or stock prices 
But with the treaty this kind of fact will be owned and subject to licensing said James Love a consumer lobbyist heading the Washingtonbased Consumer Project on Technology 
None of the treaties are ready to move 
These people do nt understand what they re doing 
At stake are billions of dollars and the future of the electronic information industry the coming medium for the distribution of music films literature software and commerce 
Supporters of the three pacts say they are only an extension of existing intellectual property rights covered by the centuryold Berne Convention 
But an array of opponents from the network industry to consumer scientific and academic groups say the pacts will give sweeping powers to entertainment and copyrightbased industries 
A quick survey at the conference centre found few officials who had actually surfed the Internet 
Mongolia s state copyright official Gundegma Jargalshaihan said apologetically that he had just arrived from Ulan Bator and was not aware of the details of the digital agenda 
We do nt have money for Internet in Mongolia he added 
Alexander Bavykin deputy legal chief at Russia s foreign ministry said Moscow had yet to formulate a policy on copyright in cybersppace 
He too had never browsed the Net 
I ve never tried it and why should I 
There are lots of other things in this life I have nt tried either he said 
A visit to the computer centre offering Internet services found a lone European official clicking away on his mouse 
Internet is a potential cash cow for copyrightbased industries and we need roadmaps on the information superhighway said Marc Pearl vicepresident of the Information Technology Association of America a trade association of US network companies opposing the treaties 
But there are a lot of dinosaurs here 
People here do nt understand Internet technology 
Because they do nt understand technology they fear the unknown 
Before the Internet those whose business was to protect copyrights knew where they stood 
Their enemies were tangible if elusive such as the people who pirated music cassettes 
But the Internet a global computer network where anything from music to software can be duplicated and distributed at the click of a computer mouse has ripped up the rulebooks 
Network operators said the draft laws would hold them responsible for copyright infringements in the system and expose them to multibilliondollar liabilities 
There are 500 million messages transmitted through the Internet everyday said Tim Casey of the USbased MCI Communications Corporation 
How can we control them all

Italian President urges separatists to turn back

Italian President Oscar Luigi Scalfaro visited the symbolic heartland of the separatist Northern League on Friday and appealed to its supporters to drop their campaign for a breakaway state 
Addressing a convention on Italian unity in Mantua where the party has set up its own parliament of the north Scalfaro made a direct appeal to what he called my friends from the League to work instead for federal reform 
It is an invitation a commitment a promise 
Let s march together Scalfaro a northerner himself said 
Help Italy to teach to propose a capacity for strong local autonomy for the federalism which can give new vigour to our blood 
But turn back from the line you are taking now he said 
Scalfaro was in Mantua to attend a ceremony commemorating the executions there by Austrian rulers in 1852 and 1853 of a group of Italians who had campaigned for national unity 
He was jeered and whistled at by a small group of League supporters when he arrived for a visit marked by heavy security 
Witnesses said the protesters were outnumbered by other Italians who waved tricolour flags in the national red white and green or shouted Viva Italia 
The League won more than eight percent of votes at the last general election in April on a federalist platform but its leader Umberto Bossi later switched to a separatist agenda

British Eurosceptic says Clarke should resign 
LONDON 19961206 
A Eurosceptic member of the ruling Conservative party said on Thursday British finance minister Kenneth Clarke had to resign to prevent the party disintegrating over the issue of a single European currency 
Member of Parliament Tony Marlow said the resignation of the chancellor of the exchequer was the only way to make the Conservatives electable in a general election which must take place by May next year 
We have a divided and split Cabinet 
This cannot endure Marlow told BBC television s Newsnight programme on Thursday 
It is not sustainable 
Kenneth Clarke has to go 
If he does nt resign the prime minister has got to fire him 
Marlow s comment come on the heels of speculation that Clarke had threatened to resign if the government changed its wait and see policy on a single currency and declared it would not sign up for the currency in the next Parliament 
Clarke denied on Thursday he had threatened to resign and said his position on the single currency was in tune with that of Prime Minister John Major 
Major told parliament on Thursday he would keep his options open on singlecurrency membership 
His statement was interpreted as a significant victory for Clarke and fellow proEuropean Michael Heseltine deputy prime minister 
ProEuropean Conservative MP Edwina Currie told the BBC that if Clarke resigned other ministers would go with him

Court ejects head of Australian childsex inquiry 
CANBERRA 19961206 
The Australian opposition on Friday demanded a highpowered investigation into paedophilia in the Australian diplomatic service after the federal court forced the head of the existing inquiry to stand aside 
The court said inquiry head Chris Hunt might be biased since he privately told a newspaper he had turned up no major evidence of paedophile activity even though he still had months of investigation before him 
Today we are left with a ruinous wreck beyond salvage and a continuing pall of doubt and suspicion hanging over our diplomatic service opposition foreign affairs spokesman Laurie Brereton said 
But the government responded by pressing ahead with the original inquiry established in May appointing a new head to lead it 
Critics say that if there were many paedophiles in senior posts in the Foreign Affairs Department then a secret inquiry would be open to internal influence and would become a public service whitewash 
Accordingly they demand an open investigation 
A spokesman for Foreign Affairs Minister Alexander Downer said the appointment of a new inquiry head administrative law expert Pamela ONeil showed the government s commitment to pursue the matter 
A report is due in May next year 
One Australian diplomat has been prosecuted this year for having sex with a Cambodian boy under 16 but was acquitted 
Police have investigated others 
A newspaper reported allegations in April that diplomats had directed Australian government aid to certain foreign orphanages to secure sex with children

Australian hitman killed wrong victim 
SYDNEY 19961206 
An Australian hitman who went to the wrong house and killed the wrong man was sentenced to 20 years jail on Friday 
Paul Crofts 33 and an accomplice were contracted to shoot a man identified only as Tony in the leg to punish him for his misconduct with a female friend of the contractor the New South Wales Supreme Court was told 
But in February 1993 Leszic Betcher was shot and killed after answering a knock at the door of his Sydney home 
The inference from all the material is that the marauders had come to the wrong house Judge Michael Grove said 
In sentencing Crofts who pleaded guilty Grove took into account his mildly retarded intellectual state which placed him in the lowest two percent of the population 
Grove said Betcher was not only the victim of a horrendous crime but his death was brought about in circumstances of an equally ghastly error on the part of the prisoner and his accomplices 
The unnamed accomplice was earlier sentenced to 20 years in prison

BreX Barrick said to continue Busang talks 
KT Arasu 
JAKARTA 19961206 
Canada s BreX Minerals Ltd and Barrick Gold Corp are to continue negotiations to hammer out a partnership agreement to develop the spectacular Busang gold find in Indonesia sources close to the talks said on Friday 
The negotiations will be held both in Toronto and in Jakarta one source speaking on condition of anonymity told Reuters 
Another source said most of the key negotiators from both BreX and Barrick had returned to Toronto but declined to say if there had been any progress in their negotiations 
Both sources said BreX and Barrick did not hold talks on Thursday with Mines and Energy Ministry SecretaryGeneral Umar Said who is coordinating the negotiations over the Busang find in East Kalimantan 
The first source also said BreX had until December 21 to submit to the Indonesian Mines and Energy Ministry a feasibility study on the central region of the Busang property estimated to contain 26 million ounces of gold 
The richest parts of the property to the north and south of the central region have been estimated by BreX to contain 57 million ounces of gold 
BreX is expected to complete the feasibility report by December 16 and submit it to the government before the December 21 deadline the source said 
He said BreX would then formally seek the permission of the Indonesian government to begin construction to develop Busang s central region which might take up to two years 
The source declined to say if there had been any progress in the talks between BreX and Barrick 
This is a huge project 
we are not selling furniture and BreX has 13000 shareholders to answer to the source said 
While there has been some agreement in principle on some issues there are still others such as procedures and mechanisms that needed to be sorted out he added 
The source said no new deadline had been set by the Mines and Energy Ministry for BreX and Barrick to strike a deal 
The Ministry had given the companies until December 4 to complete a partnership deal and advised BreX to take a 25 percent stake and Barrick 75 percent to develop the property 
As far as I am aware there s been no new deadline the source said 
The Ministry s Umar said on Thursday that both BreX and Barrick had responded positively to a government letter recommending a 2575 split in the Busang gold property 
The government also wants 10 percent of the property 
Umar said the government had yet to receive a formal reply from the companies 
He had said earlier that if the two companies failed to reach a partnership agreement the government would explore other ways to expedite development of the Busang find 
BreX has a partnership deal with PT Panutan Duta of the Panutan Group run by President Suharto s eldest son Sigit Harjojudanto under which Panutan would receive 40 million over 40 months plus a 10 percent stake Busang s richest parts 
Barrick has teamed up with a construction company in the Citra Group of Suharto s eldest daughter Siti Hardianti Rukmana in what Barrick had said was a partnership to prepare us for a potential mining development project

FEATURE Singapore sees prestige in hosting WTO 
Ramthan Hussain 
SINGAPORE 19961206 
Singapore s winning campaign to host the World Trade Organisation WTO s first ministerial meeting reflected its ambition to play a key role in shaping global free trade the lifeblood of its economy analysts said 
As one of the world s most externally oriented economies Singapore has a disproportionately large stake in the WTO said Desmond Supple economist at research house IDEA 
Singapore stands to benefit more than most from continued global trade liberalisation as trade is the engine of its growth accounting for nearly three times its gross domestic product 
The citystate met US opposition two years ago in its bid to host the meeting expected to gather 4000 officials from 160 countries from December 9 to 13 
In a stand some analysts linked to controversy over Singapore s caning of an American teenager for vandalism thenUS Trade Representative Mickey Kantor had said the meeting ought to be held where the WTO was going to be headquartered 
That would have meant Geneva 
But Singapore had the support of other WTO members 
Derek da Cunha senior fellow at the Institute of Policy Studies ISEAS said Singapore s hosting of the conference carries a great deal of symbolism for the citystate underscoring its commitment to free trade and its trading links across the globe 
There is the international prestige Singapore would enjoy but more importantly there is a genuine national interest in fostering better global free trade and an open market said Tan Kong Yam head of Business Policy at the National University of Singapore 
At the ministerial meeting trade ministers will review the work of the WTO and the implementation of the Uruguay Round free trade commitments under its predecessor the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade GATT 
In June the WTO hailed Singapore for its open market policies but the European Union and other trading powers called on Singapore to speed up the opening of its services sector 
Supple said the struggle that Singapore had to wage in vying to host the meeting would be repeated during the talks 
There is tension at every step of the way since a battle line between the West and developing countries has been drawn over the issue of linking trade liberalisation with labour rights he said 
Supple said hosting the meeting carried prestige for Singapore however this is quite intangible as the prestige factor may not necessarily lead to any additional investment and trade flows to this region 
From a commercial point of view the meeting would be good for Singapore s tourism industry Tan said 
A large part of Singapore s workforce would be mobilised to ensure the meeting would run without a glitch but the average Singaporean would probably not be too concerned about some of the issues Tan said 
But the more educated public will realise that these kind of things are important for Singapore as a small economy 
Supple said any political gains the Singapore government would get from the WTO meeting ahead of a general election due by April 1997 would depend on how successful it was in pushing its economic agenda 
If there are any movements toward freer trade then Singapore s economy and the electorate would gain he said 
But I do nt think it would be wise to play up the political aspect of this 
I think political issues will take secondary importance to all these economic issues that will be displayed

CRICKET WOOLMER MAKES SENTIMENTAL RETURN TO KANPUR 
KANPUR India 19961207 
South Africa s trip to Kanpur for the third test against India has given former England test cricketer Bob Woolmer the chance of a sentimental return to his birthplace 
Woolmer was born in the northern city of Kanpur when his father worked there for an insurance compnay and was himself an active cricketer 
It s been a sentimental journey 
A visit to India is always an intriguing experience Woolmer now the South African coach said on Saturday 
Woolmer 48 played 19 tests for England between 1975 and 1981 
His first cricketing sojurn to India was as a member of Tony Greig s England side in 197677 
His father Clarence Woolmer represented United Province now renamed Uttar Pradesh in India s Ranji Trophy national championship and captained the state during 1949 
Now aged 86 Woolmer senior lives with his son in Cape Town 
Woolmer s memories of Kanpur are few and blurred 
I do nt remember much of the place he said 
I came here on zero and left at three aged three when my father was transferred to Calcutta where I spent another four and half years 
But I do remember we had a cobra snake in the basement of our house 
Also that my father bought a bicycle and when we rode over a hose pipe it broke into two 
Woolmer said the hospital where he was born is close to the stadium where the IndiaSouth Africa test will be played

ALPINE SKIINGOFFICIALS HOPE TO SALVAGE WORLD CUP WEEKEND 
WHISTLER British Columbia 19961206 
World Cup ski officials hope to be able to get in at least one men s downhill training run on Saturday in an effort to salvage the weekend racing programme 
For the third consecutive day Friday s scheduled training runs were cancelled due to heavy wet snow and fog on Whistler Mountain leaving the scheduled World Cup events in jeopardy 
Rules call for at least one training run to be completed before a World Cup downhill race can be staged 
Organisers hope to get that run in on Saturday morning conditions permitting and stage the race later in the day or on Sunday 
There was no possibility today to make a training run said Bernd Zobel the Canadian men s national coach citing too much new snow and poor visibility 
If organisers are forced to run the downhill on Sunday the supergiant slalom originally scheduled for Sunday would likely be abandoned

RUGBY UNION RETIRING CAMPESE WEIGHS UP OPTIONS 
LONDON 19961207 
David Campese will consider offers to play club rugby in England but looks more likely to spend the next year chasing business opportunities in Australia 
The 34yearold winger played his final game in a Wallaby jersey on Saturday but is currently a target for clubs eager to match London side Saracens who have already snapped up Francois Pienaar Michael Lynagh and Philippe Sella 
If the opportunity is there I d obviously think about it but the thing that holds me back is business said Campese 
I d like to come over but there are a lot of things happening at home 
I ve also got a contract to play for New South Wales in the Super 12 next year 
Former Wallaby captain Nick FarrJones believes Campese may yet be tempted to England 
I m sure there are a few people in England who d be delighted to have David Campese in their club s jersey he said

TIRANA 19961207 
Albanian coach Astrit Hafizi said on Saturday it was important that his players brush aside the country s short ban by FIFA in order to concentrate on next SaturdaysWorld Cup group nine qualifier against Northern Ireland

Especially if one takes into consideration our difficult postsuspension situation and the fact Northern Ireland is very keen to win

SOCCER SOUTH KOREA MOVE CLOSE TO QUARTERFINAL BERTH 
ABU DHABI 19961207 
South Korea made virtually certain of an Asian Cup quarterfinal spot with a 42 win over Indonesia in a Group A match on Saturday 
After going four up in the first 55 minutes South Korea allowed Indonesia newcomers to Asian Cup finals back into the match conceding two goals from rare counter attacks 
Kim Do Hoon opened the scoring for South Korea in only the fifth minute turning unmarked on the penalty spot to fire a shot into the top corner 
It looked like turning into a rout as Hwang Sun Hong rapidly added two more in the seventh and 15th minutes but although the Koreans continued to dominate they failed to add to the score before the interval 
But they started the second half where they had left off and it was not long before they went four up Ko Jeong Woon heading in from a free kick in the 55th minute 
The Koreans then appeared to relax allowing the Indonesians to get back into the match 
Ronny Wabia scored for Indonesia three minutes later direct from a a corner kick that Korean goalkeeper Kim Byung reached with one hand but failed to keep out 
With 65 minutes gone Indonesia s Widodo Putra who scored a spectacular goal against Kuwait on Wednesday was again on target breaking through the Korean defence to beat the keeper with a low shot 
Indonesian keeper Hendro Kartiko produced a string of fine saves to prevent the Koreans increasing their lead

NHL ICE HOCKEY CANUCKS RW BURE SUSPENDED FOR ONE GAME 
NEW YORK 19961206 
Vancouver Canucks star right wing Pavel Bure was suspended for one game by the National Hockey League and fined 1000 Friday for his hit on Buffalo Sabres defenceman Garry Galley on Wednesday 
Bure received a doubleminor penalty for highsticking with 222 left in the first period of Wednesday s 76 overtime win by Vancouver after colliding with Galley in Buffalo zone 
Galley suffered a concussion and did not return to the game 
Mr Bure left his feet to deliver a forearm blow to Mr Galley as he was about to be checked legally by his opponent said NHL discipline chief Brian Burke in handing out the suspension 
Although it is clear from the videotape that Mr Bure s actions were a reaction to the impending hit and there was no intent to injure his opponent there can be no excuse for this type of conduct Burke said 
Bure who is struggling with only nine goals and 12 assists in 26 games will miss Saturday s home game against Ottawa

SOCCER ENGLISHMAN CHARLTON IS MADE AN HONORARY IRISHMAN 
DUBLIN 19961207 
Jack Charlton s relationship with the people of Ireland was cemented on Saturday when the Englishman was officially declared one of their own 
Charlton 61 and his wife Peggy became citizens of Ireland when they formally received Irish passports from deputy Prime Minister Dick Spring who said the honour had been made in recognition of Charlton s achievements as the national soccer manager 
The years I spent as manager of the Republic of Ireland were the best years of my life 
It all culminated in the fact that I now have lots of great great friends in Ireland 
That is why this is so emotional a night for me Charlton said 
It was the joy that we all had over the period that I shared with people that I grew to love that I treasure most he added 
Charlton managed Ireland for 93 matches during which time they lost only 17 times in almost 10 years until he resigned in December 1995 
He guided Ireland to two successive World Cup finals tournaments and to the 1988 European championship finals in Germany after the Irish beat a wellfancied England team 10 in their group qualifier 
The lanky former Leeds United defender did not make his England debut until the age of 30 but eventually won 35 caps and was a key member of the 1966 World Cup winning team with his younger brother Bobby
